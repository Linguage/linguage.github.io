<meta property="og:title" content="Linguista"><meta property="og:description" content="Andrew Ng: Agentic AI Module 1: Introduction to Agentic Workflows 1.0 Introduction 0:02 Welcome to this course on Agentic AI. When I coined the term agentic to describe what I saw 0:05 as an important and rapidly growing trend in how people were building on-base applications, 0:10 what I did not realize was that a bunch of marketers would get hold of this term 0:14 and use it as a sticker and put this on almost everything in sight. And that has caused hype 0:20 on Agentic AI to skyrocket. The good news though is that ignoring the hype, the number of truly 0:27 valuable and useful applications built using Agentic AI has also grown very rapidly, even if 0:33 not quite as rapidly as the hype. And in this course, what I&#39;d like to do is show you best 0:38 practices for building Agentic AI applications. And this will open up a lot of new opportunities 0:44 to you in terms of what you can now build. Today, agentic workflows are being used to build 0:49 applications like customer support agents, or to do deep research to help write deeply insightful 0:55 research reports, or to process tricky legal documents, or to look at patient input and render 1:02 or to suggest possible medical diagnoses. On many of my teams, a lot of the projects we built just 1:08 would be impossible without agentic workflows. And so knowing how to build applications with them 1:14 is one of the most important and valuable skills in AI today. It turns out that one of the biggest 1:20 differences I&#39;ve seen between people that really know how to build agentic workflows compared to 1:24 people that are less effective at it is the ability to drive a disciplined development process, 1:30 specifically one focused on evals and error analysis. And in this course, I&#39;ll tell you what 1:35 that means and show you what allows you to be really good at building these agentic workflows. 1:41 Being able to do this is one of the most important skills in AI today and will open up a lot more 1:46 opportunities, be it job opportunities or opportunities to just build amazing software 1:51 yourself. With that, let&#39;s go on to the next video to dive more into what are agentic workflows. 1.1 What is an agentic AI 0:03 So what is Agentic AI and why are Agentic AI workflows so powerful? Let&#39;s take a look. 0:05 The way that many of us use large language models or LLMs today is by prompting it to say, 0:11 write an essay for us on a certain topic X. And I think of that as akin to going to a human, 0:17 or in this case, going to an AI and asking it to please type out an essay for me by writing 0:22 from the first word to the last word all in one go and without ever using backspace. 0:27 It turns out that we as people, we don&#39;t do our best writing like that by being forced to write 0:32 in this completely linear order and nor do AI models. But despite the difficulty of being 0:38 constrained to write in this way, our LLMs do surprisingly well. In contrast, with an agentic 0:43 workflow, this is what the process might look like. You may ask it to first write an essay 0:48 outline on a certain topic, then ask if it needs to do any web research. And after doing some web 0:53 research and maybe downloading some web pages, then to write the first draft and then to read 0:57 the first draft and see what parts need revision or more research and then revise the draft and so 1:02 on. And this type of workflow is more akin to doing some thinking and some research and then 1:06 doing some revision and then doing some more thinking and so on. And with this iterative 1:12 process, it turns out that an agentic workflow can take longer, but it delivers a much better 1:18 work product. So an agentic AI workflow is a process where an LLM based app executes multiple 1:25 steps to complete a task. In this example, you might use an LLM to write the first essay outline 1:31 and then you might use an LLM to decide what search terms to type into a web search engine or 1:37 really what search terms to call a web search API with in order to get back relevant web pages. 1:44 Based on that, you can feed the downloaded web pages into an LLM to have it write the first draft 1:51 and then maybe use another LLM to reflect and decide what needs more revision. And then depending 1:57 on how you design this workflow, perhaps you may even add a human in the loop step where the LLM 2:03 has the option to request human review, maybe of some key facts. And based on that, it may then 2:10 revise the draft and this process results in a much better work output. One of the key skills 2:16 you learn in this course is how to take a complex task like writing an essay and breaking it down 2:24 into smaller steps for agentic workflows to execute one step at a time to then get the work output 2:31 that you want. And knowing how to decompose the task into steps and how to build the components 2:36 to execute the individual steps well turns out to be a tricky but important skill that will 2:42 determine your ability to build agentic workflows for a huge range of exciting applications. In this 2:48 course, a running example that we&#39;ll use and something that you build alongside me is a research 2:54 agent. So here&#39;s an example of what it will look like. You can enter a research topic like how do I 3:00 build a new rocket company to compete with SpaceX. I don&#39;t personally want to compete with SpaceX, 3:08 but if you want to, you can try asking a research agent to help your background research. 3:13 So this agent starts with planning out what research to use, including calling a web search 3:20 engine to download some web pages, and then to synthesize and rank findings, draft an outline, 3:26 have an editor-to-agent review for coherence, and then finally generate a comprehensive 3:30 markdown report, which it has done here, building a new rocket company to compete with SpaceX 3:35 with an intro, background, findings, and so on. I think it points out appropriately that 3:41 this is going to be a tough startup to build, so I&#39;m not personally planning to do this, but if 3:47 you want to tackle something like this, maybe a research agent like this could help you with some 3:53 initial research. And by finding and downloading multiple sources and deeply thinking about it, 4:00 this actually ends up with a much more thoughtful report than just prompting an LLM to write an essay 4:07 for you would. One of the reasons I&#39;m excited about this is because in my work, I&#39;ve ended up 4:12 building quite a few specialized research agents, be it in legal documents for conflict legal 4:18 compliance, or for some healthcare sectors, or some business product research areas. And so I hope 4:24 that working through this example, you not only learn how to build agentic workflows for many 4:29 other applications, but that some of the ideas in building research agents will be directly useful 4:34 to you if you ever need to build a custom research agent yourself. Now, one of the often discussed 4:42 areas of AI agents is how autonomous are they? What you just saw here was a relatively complex, 4:49 highly autonomous Agentic AI workflow, but there are also other simpler workflows that are 4:55 incredibly valuable. Let&#39;s go on to the next video to talk about the degree to which agentic 5:00 workflows can be autonomous, and does it give you a framework to think about how 5:05 you might go about building different applications and how easy or difficult they might be. 5:10 See you in the next video. 1.2 Degrees of autonomy 0:02 Agents can be autonomous to different degrees. A few years ago, I noticed within the AI community 0:06 that there was a growing controversial debate about what is an agent, and some people are 0:10 writing a paper saying I built an agent, and others will say, no, that&#39;s not really a true 0:14 agent. And I felt this debate was unnecessary, which is why I started using the term agentic, 0:21 because I thought if we use it as an adjective rather than a binary, it&#39;s either an agent or not, 0:26 then we&#39;re going to have to acknowledge that systems can be agentic to different degrees. 0:31 And let&#39;s just call it all agentic and move on with the real work of building these systems 0:36 rather than debating, you know, is this sufficiently autonomous to be an agent or not? 0:40 I remember when I prepared a talk on agentic reasoning, one of my team members actually 0:46 came to me and said, hey, Andrew, we don&#39;t need yet another word. You know, we have agent, 0:50 why are you making up another word, agentic? But I decided to use it anyway. And then later on, 0:55 wrote an article in a given newsletter, The Batch, and then also posted on social media, 1:01 saying that instead of arguing over which word to include or exclude as being a true agent, 1:06 let&#39;s acknowledge that different degrees to which systems can be agentic. And I think this helped 1:11 move past the debate on what is a true agent and let us just focus on actually building them. 1:18 Some agents can be less autonomous. So take the example of writing an essay about black holes. 1:25 You can have a relatively simple agent to come up with a few web search terms or web search queries. 1:31 Then you can hard code in that you call a web search engine, fetch some web pages, 1:37 and then use that to write an essay. And this is an example of a less autonomous agent 1:41 with a fully deterministic sequence of steps. And this will work okay. 1:46 In terms of notational convention, throughout this course, I&#39;ll use the red color, 1:50 as you see here on the left, to denote the user input, such as a user query in this case, 1:56 or in later examples, maybe the input document into an agentic workflow. 2:00 The gray boxes denote calls to an LLM, and the green boxes, like the web search and the web 2:07 fetch boxes that you see here, indicate steps where other software is being used to carry out 2:13 an action, such as a web search API call or executing code to fetch the contents of a website. 2:18 Then an agent can be more autonomous, where, given a request to write an essay about black holes, 2:24 perhaps you let the LLM decide, does it want to do a web search, or does it want to search 2:29 recent news sources, or does it want to search for recent research papers on the website archive? 2:34 Based on that, maybe in this example, the LLM, not the human engineer, but the LLM chooses, 2:39 in this case, to call a web search engine, and then after that, you may let the LLM decide 2:44 how many web pages does it want to fetch, or if it fetches the PDF, does it need to 2:50 call a function, or also call a tool, to convert the PDF to text? 2:53 And in this case, maybe it fetches its top few web pages, then it can write an essay, 2:59 decide whether to reflect and improve, and maybe even go back to fetch more web pages, 3:03 and then to finally produce an output. 3:06 And so even for this example of a research agent, we can see that some agents can be 3:13 less autonomous, with a linear sequence of steps to be executed, determined by a programmer, 3:18 and some can be more autonomous, where you trust the LLM to make more decisions, 3:22 and the exact sequence of steps that happens may be even determined by the LLM, rather than 3:26 in advance by the programmer. 3:28 So for less autonomous systems, you will usually have all the steps predetermined in advance, 3:34 and any functions it calls, like web search, and we&#39;ll call that tool use, as you learn 3:38 in the third module in this course, might be hard-coded by the human engineer, by you 3:43 or me, and most of the autonomy is in what text the LLM generates. 3:47 At the end of the spectrum would be highly autonomous agents, where the agent makes many 3:51 decisions autonomously, including, for example, deciding what is the sequence of steps it 3:56 will carry out in order to write the essay. 3:59 And there&#39;s some highly autonomous agents that can even write new functions, or sometimes 4:04 create new tools that it can then execute. 4:06 And somewhere in between are semi-autonomous agents, where it can make some decisions, 4:11 choose tools, but the tools are usually more predefined. 4:14 As you look at different examples in this course, you learn how to build applications 4:18 anywhere on this spectrum of less to more highly autonomous, and you find that there 4:22 are tons of applications in the less autonomous end of the spectrum that are very valuable 4:26 being built for tons of businesses today, and at the same time, there are also applications 4:31 being worked on at the more highly autonomous end of the spectrum, but those are usually 4:36 less easily controllable, a little bit more unpredictable, and also a lot of active research 4:42 as well to figure out how to build these more highly autonomous agents. 4:46 And with that, let&#39;s go on to the next video to dive deeper into this and to hear about 4:53 some of the benefits of using agents and why they allow us to do things that just were 4:57 not possible with earlier generations of base applications. 1.3 Benefits of agentic workflows 0:03 I think the one biggest benefit of agentic workflows is that it allows you to do many 0:04 tasks effectively that just previously were not possible. But there are other benefits as well, 0:10 including parallelism that lets you do certain things quite fast, as well as modularity that 0:14 lets you combine the best of three components from many different places to build an effective 0:19 workflow. Let&#39;s take a look. My team collected some data on a coding benchmark that tests the 0:26 ability of different LLMs to write code to carry out certain tasks. The benchmark used in this case 0:32 is called Human Eval, and it turns out that GPT 3.5, this is a model that the first publicly 0:38 available version of Chat GPT was based on, if asked to write the code directly, to just type 0:42 out the computer program, gets 40% right on this benchmark. This is a positive k-metric. GPT 4 is 0:49 a much better model. Its performance leaps to 67% with this also non-agentic workflow. But it turns 0:56 out that as large as the improvement was from GPT 3.5 to GPT 4, that improvement is dwarfed by what 1:03 you can achieve by wrapping GPT 3.5 within an agentic workflow. Using different agentic techniques, 1:10 which you&#39;ll learn about later in this course, you can prompt GPT 3.5 to write code and then maybe 1:15 reflect on the code and figure out if you can improve it. And using techniques like that, you can 1:20 actually get GPT 3.5 to get much higher levels of performance. And similarly, GPT 4 used in the 1:26 context of an agentic workflow also does much better. So even with today&#39;s best LLMs, an agentic 1:33 workflow lets you get much better performance. And in fact, what we saw in this example was the 1:39 improvement from one generation of model to another, which is huge, is still not as big a difference 1:45 as implementing an agentic workflow on the previous generation of model. Another benefit of 1:51 using agentic workflows is that they can parallelize some tasks and thus do certain things much faster 1:57 than a human. For example, if you ask an agentic workflow to write an essay about black holes, you 2:04 might be able to have three LLMs run in parallel to generate ideas for web search terms to type 2:10 into the search engine. Based on the first web search, it may identify, say, three top results to 2:16 fetch. And based on the second web search, it may identify a second set of web pages to fetch and so 2:22 on. And it turns out that whereas a human doing this research would have to read these nine web 2:28 pages sequentially or one at a time, when you&#39;re using an agentic workflow, you can actually 2:33 parallelize all nine web page downloads and then finally feed all these things into an LLM to write 2:39 an essay. So even though agentic workflows do take longer than truly non-agentic workflows or by 2:45 direct generation by just prompting a single time, if you were to compare this type of agentic 2:51 workflow to how a human would have to go about the task, the ability to parallelize downloading lots 2:56 of web pages can actually let it do certain tasks much faster than the non-parallel sequential way 3:02 that a single human might process this data. To build on this example, it turns out one of the 3:08 things I often do when building agentic workflows is look at the individual components like the LLM 3:14 and add or swap out components. So for example, maybe I look at the web search engine I use up 3:20 here and I might decide that I want to soften a new web search engine. When building agentic 3:24 workflows, there are actually multiple web search engines including Google, which you can access 3:29 by a server, as well as others like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Tavily, u.com. There are actually quite a lot of 3:35 options for web search engines designed for LLMs to use. Or maybe instead of just doing three web 3:40 searches, maybe on this step we can swap in a new news search engine so we can find out what&#39;s the 3:47 latest news on recent breakthroughs on black hole science. And lastly, instead of using the same LLM 3:55 for all of the different steps, I will often try out different large language models and maybe try 4:01 out different LLM providers to see which one gives the best result for different steps of this system. 4:07 So to summarize, the main reason I use agentic workflows is it just gives much better performance 4:13 on many different applications. But in addition, it can also paralyze some tasks that humans would 4:20 otherwise have to do sequentially. And the modular design of many agentic workflows also lets us 4:27 add or update tools and sometimes swap out models. We&#39;ve talked a lot about the key components of 4:33 building agentic workflows. Let&#39;s now take a look at a range of Agentic AI applications to give you 4:39 a sense of the sorts of things people are already building and the sorts of things 4:43 you&#39;ll build yourself. Let&#39;s go on to the next video. 1.4 Agentic AI applications 0:00 Let&#39;s take a look at some examples of Agentic AI applications. 0:04 One task that many businesses carry out is invoice processing. 0:09 So given an invoice like this, you might want to write software to extract the most important 0:14 fields, which for this application, let&#39;s say is the biller, that would be tech flow solutions, 0:19 the biller address, the amount due, which is $3,000, and the due date, which looks like it is 0:25 August 20th, 2025. So in many finance departments, maybe a human would look at invoices and identify 0:33 the most important fields, who do we need to pay by when, and record these in a database to make 0:39 sure that payment is issued in time. If you were to implement this with an agentic workflow, 0:44 you might do so like this. You write input an invoice, then call a PDF to text conversion API 0:51 to turn the PDF into maybe formatted text, such as markdown text for the LLM to ingest. Then the LLM 0:57 will look at the PDF and figure out, is this actually an invoice or is this some other type 1:02 of document that they should just ignore? And if it is an invoice, then it will pull up the required 1:07 fields as well as use an API or use a tool to update the database in order to save the most 1:14 important fields in the database records. So one aspect of this agentic workflow is that 1:20 there is a clear process to follow, is identify the required fields and record in the database. 1:26 Tasks like these with a clear process you want followed tend to be maybe easier for agentic 1:31 workflows to carry out because it leads to a relatively step-by-step way to reliably carry 1:36 out this task. Here&#39;s another example, maybe just a little bit harder. So if you want to build an 1:41 agent to respond to basic customer order inquiries, then the steps might be to extract the key 1:48 information, so figure out what exactly did the customer order, what&#39;s the customer&#39;s name, then 1:53 look up the relevant customer records, and then finally draft a response for human to review before 2:00 the email response is sent to the customer. So again, there&#39;s a clear process here and we 2:04 will implement this step-by-step, where we take the email, feed it to an LLM to verify or to extract 2:10 the order details, and assuming the customer email is about an order, the LLM might then choose to 2:16 call an order&#39;s database to then pull up that information. That information then goes to the LLM 2:22 to then draft an email response, and the LLM might choose to use a request review tool that, say, puts 2:29 this draft email from the LLM into queue for humans to review, so they can then be sent out after a 2:34 human has reviewed and approved it. So customer order inquiry agents like these are being built 2:40 and deployed in many businesses today. To look at a more challenging example, if you want to build a 2:45 customer service agent to respond not just to questions about an order they place, but to respond 2:51 to a more general set of questions, anything a customer may ask, and maybe the customer will ask, 2:57 do you have any black jeans or blue jeans? And to answer this question, you need to maybe make 3:03 multiple API calls to your database to first check the inventory for black jeans, then check inventory 3:08 for blue jeans, and then respond to the customer. So this is an example of a more challenging query, 3:14 where given a user input, you actually have to plan out what is the sequence of database queries 3:19 to check for inventory. Or if a user asks, I&#39;d like to return the beach towel I bought, then to answer 3:25 this, maybe we need to verify that the customer actually bought a beach towel, and then double 3:31 check the return policy. Maybe our set returns only 30 days within the date of purchase, and only the 3:36 towel was unused. And if return is allowed, then have the agent issue a return packing slip, and 3:42 also set the database record to return pending. So in this example, if the required steps to process 3:48 the customer requests are not known ahead of time, then it results in a more challenging process, 3:54 where the LLM base application has to decide for itself that these are the three steps needed in 4:00 order to respond appropriately to this task. But you learn about some of the latest work on how to 4:06 approach this type of problem too. And to give one last example of maybe an especially difficult 4:12 type of agent to build, there&#39;s a lot of work on computer use by agents, in which agents will 4:17 attempt to use a web browser and read a web page to figure out how to carry out a complex task. 4:24 In this example, I&#39;ve asked an agent to check whether seats are available on two specific United 4:30 Airlines flights from San Francisco to Washington DC, or the DCA airport. The agent has access to 4:36 a web browser they can use to carry out this task. And in the video here, you can see it navigating 4:41 the United website independently, clicking on page elements and filling in the text fields on the page 4:46 to carry out the search that I requested. As it works, the agent reasons over the content of the 4:52 page to figure out the actions it needs to take to complete the task, and what it should do next. 4:57 In this case, there&#39;s some trouble checking flights on the United site, and instead decides to 5:02 navigate to the Google Flights website to search for available flights. On the Google Flight, you 5:08 see here it finds several flight options that match the user&#39;s query, and the agent then picks one and 5:13 is taken back to the United website, where it looks like it&#39;s now on the correct web page, and so is 5:20 able to determine that yes, there are seats available on the flights that I asked about. So computer use 5:26 is an exciting cutting-edge area of research right now, and many companies are trying to get computer 5:30 use agents to work. While the agent you saw here did eventually figure out the answer, I often see 5:36 agents having trouble using web browsers well. For example, if a web page is slow to load, an agent 5:42 may fail to understand what&#39;s going on, and many web pages are still beyond agents&#39; abilities to 5:47 pause or to read accurately. But I think computer use agents, even though not yet reliable enough 5:53 to use mission-critical applications today, are an exciting and important area of future development. 5:58 So when I&#39;m considering building Agentic AI workflows, the tasks that are easier will tend to be ones 6:05 where there is a clear step-by-step process, or if a business already has a standard procedure, a 6:11 standard offering procedure to follow, and then it can be quite a lot of work to take that procedure 6:15 and codify it up in an AI agent, but that tends to lead to easier implementations. One thing that 6:21 makes it easier is if you are using text-only assets, because LLM/language models have 6:27 grown up really processing text, and if you need to process other input modalities, it may well be 6:33 doable, but it maybe gets a little bit harder. And on the harder end of the spectrum, if the steps are 6:38 not known ahead of time of what&#39;s needed to carry out a task, like you saw for the more advanced 6:42 customer service agent, then the agent may need to plan or solve as you go, and this tends to be 6:47 harder and more unpredictable and less reliable. And then as mentioned, if it needs to accept rich 6:52 multi-modal inputs such as sound, vision, audio, that also tends to be less reliable than the 6:58 only header process text. So I hope that gives you a sense of the types of applications you might build 7:05 with agentic workflows. When implementing one of these things yourself, one of the most important 7:10 skills is to look at a complex workflow and figure out what are the individual steps so you can 7:16 implement an agentic workflow to execute those steps one at a time. In the next video, we&#39;ll talk 7:22 about task decomposition, that is, given a complex thing you want to do, like write a research report 7:28 or have a customer agent get back to customers, how do you break that down into discrete steps 7:34 to try to implement an agentic workflow? Let&#39;s go see that in the next video. 1.5 Task decomposition: Identifying the steps in a workflow 0:00 People and businesses do a lot of stuff. How do you take this useful stuff that we do 0:06 and break it down into discrete steps for the agentic workflow to follow? Let&#39;s take a look. 0:12 Take the example of building a research agent. If you want an AI system to write an essay on 0:18 a topic X, one thing you could do is prompt an LLM to have it generate an output directly. 0:24 But if you were to do this for topics that you want deeply researched, 0:28 you may find that the LLM output covers only the surface level points, or maybe covers only the 0:33 obvious facts, but doesn&#39;t go as deep into the subject as you want it to. In this case, you 0:39 might then reflect on how you as a human would write an essay on a certain topic. Would you just 0:45 sit down and start writing, or would you take multiple steps, such as first write an essay 0:50 outline, and then search the rep, and then based on the input from the web search, write the essay. 0:55 As I take a task and decompose it into steps, one question I&#39;m always asking myself is, 1:00 if I look at these steps one, two, and three, can each of them be done either by an LLM, or 1:07 by a short piece of code, or by a function call, or by a tool. In this case, I think an LLM can 1:13 maybe write a decent outline on many topics that I would want it to help me think through. So, 1:20 say probably okay on the first step, and then I know how to use an LLM to generate search terms 1:26 to search the web. So, I would say the second step is also doable, and then based on web search, 1:31 I think an LLM could input the web search results and write an essay. And so, this would be a 1:35 reasonable first attempt at an agentic workflow for writing an essay that goes deeper than just 1:41 direct generation. But if I were to then implement this agentic workflow and look at the results, 1:47 maybe you find that the results still aren&#39;t good enough. It&#39;s still not yet as deeply thoughtful. 1:51 Maybe the essays feel a little bit disjointed. This has actually happened to me. I once built 1:56 a research agent using this workflow, but when I read the output, it felt a bit disjointed. 2:00 You know, the start of the article didn&#39;t feel completely consistent with the middle, 2:04 didn&#39;t feel completely consistent with the end. In this case, what you might do is then reflect 2:09 on how you would change the workflow if you as a human found that the essay is a little bit 2:13 disjointed. One thing you could do is take the third step and further decompose, write the essay 2:21 into additional steps. So, instead of writing the essay on one go, you might instead have it 2:27 write the first draft, and then consider what parts need revision, and then revise the draft. 2:32 And this would be how I as a human might go about it, to not just write the final essay at my first 2:39 attempt, but write the first draft and then read over it, which is another step that the LLM is 2:44 pretty decent at. And then based on my own critique of my own essay, I&#39;ll revise the draft. 2:49 So to recap, I started off with direct generation, just one step, decided it wasn&#39;t good enough, 2:55 and so broke that down into three steps, and then maybe decided that still isn&#39;t good enough, 3:00 and took one of the steps and further broken it down or decomposed it into three more steps, 3:05 resulting in this more complex, richer process for generating an essay. And depending on how 3:12 satisfied you are with the results of this process, you may choose to even modify this essay 3:18 generation process further. Let&#39;s look at the second example of how to decompose complex tasks 3:23 into smaller steps. Take the example of responding to basic customer order inquiries. The first step 3:30 that a human customer specialization might carry out might be to first extract the key information, 3:36 such as who is this email from, what did they order, and what is the order number. And these 3:41 are things that an LLM could do. So I could just say, let&#39;s have an LLM do that. The second step 3:46 would be to then find the relevant customer records. So to write and generate the relevant 3:51 database queries to pull up the order of what the customer had ordered and when I shipped and so on. 3:56 I think an LLM with the ability to call a function to query the orders database should be able to do 4:04 that. And lastly, having pulled up the customer record or the customer order record, I might then 4:09 write and send a response back to the customer. And I think with the information we pulled up, 4:13 this third step is also doable with an LLM if I give the option to call an API to send an email. 4:19 So this would be another example of taking a task of responding to customer email and breaking it 4:25 down into three individual steps where I can look at each of these steps and say, yep, I think an LLM 4:30 or one LLM with the ability to call a function to query a database or send an email should be able 4:35 to do that. Just one last example for the invoice processing. After a PDF invoice has been converted 4:42 to text, the first step is to pull out the required information, the name of the biller, the address, 4:47 the due date, the amount due, and so on. And now I should be able to do that. And then if I want to 4:53 check that the information was extracted and save it in a new database entry, then I think an LLM 4:58 should be able to help me call a function to update the database record. And so to implement this, 5:04 we implement an agentic workflow to carry out basically these two steps. When building agentic 5:09 workflows, I think of myself as having a number of building blocks. One important building block 5:15 would be large language models or maybe large multimodal models if I want to try to process 5:20 images or audio as well. And LLMs are good at generating text, deciding what to call, 5:25 maybe extracting information. For some highly specialized tasks, I might also use some other 5:31 AI models, such as an AI model for converting a PDF to text or for text-to-speech or for image 5:38 analysis. In addition to AI models, I also have access to a number of software tools, including 5:45 different APIs that I can call to do voice search, to get maybe real-time weather data, 5:51 to send emails, check calendar, and so on. And I might also have tools to retrieve information, 5:57 to pull up data from a database, or to invent RAG or retrieval augmented generation, 6:03 where I can look up a large text database and find the most relevant text. Or I might also 6:07 have tools to execute code. And this is a tool that lets an LLM write code and then run the code 6:13 on your computer to do a huge range of things. In case some of these tools seem a bit foreign to 6:18 you, don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ll go through the most important tools in much greater detail in 6:23 a later module. But I think of a lot of my work when I&#39;m building an agent workflow as looking at 6:29 the work that the person or business is doing and then trying to figure out with these building 6:33 blocks, how can I sequence these building blocks together in order to carry out the tasks that I 6:39 want my system to carry out. And this is why having a good understanding of what building 6:44 blocks are available, which I hope you have a better sense of by the end of this course as well, 6:49 will allow you to better envision what agentic workflows you can build by combining these 6:54 building blocks together. So to summarize, one of the key skills in building agentic workflows is 6:59 to look at a bunch of stuff that maybe someone does and to identify the discrete steps that 7:06 it could be implemented with. And when I&#39;m looking at the individual discrete steps, 7:10 one question I&#39;m always asking myself is, can this step be implemented with either an 7:16 LLM or with one of the tools such as an API or a function call that I have access to? And in case 7:22 the answer is no, I&#39;ll then often ask myself, how would I as a human do this step? And is it 7:28 possible to decompose this further or break this down into even smaller steps that then maybe is 7:34 more amenable to implementation with an LLM or with one of the software tools that I have? 7:40 So I hope this gives you a rough sense of how to think about task decomposition. In case you feel 7:45 like you don&#39;t fully have it yet, don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ll go through many more examples 7:50 in this course and you have a much better understanding of this by the end of this 7:54 course. But it turns out that as you build agentic workflows, you find that often you 7:59 build an initial task decomposition, initial agentic workflow, and then you want to keep 8:05 on iterating and improving on it quite a few times until it delivers the level of performance 8:10 that you want. And to drive this improvement process, which I found important for many 8:15 projects, one of the key skills is to know how to evaluate your agentic workflow. So in the next 8:21 video, we&#39;ll talk about evaluations or evals and discrete key components, how you can build, 8:28 and then also keep on improving your workflows to get the performance 8:31 that you want. Let&#39;s talk about evals in the next video. 1.6 Evaluations agentic (evals) 0:04 I&#39;ve worked with many different teams on building agentic workflows, and I&#39;ve found that one 0:05 of the biggest predictors for whether someone is able to do it really well versus be less 0:10 efficient at it is whether or not they&#39;re able to drive a really disciplined evaluation 0:16 process. 0:17 So, your ability to drive evals for your agentic workflow makes a huge difference in your ability 0:23 to build them effectively. 0:26 In this video, we&#39;ll take a quick overview of how to build evals, and this is a subject 0:30 that we&#39;ll actually go into much deeper in a later module in this course. 0:35 So, let&#39;s take a look. 0:37 After building an agentic workflow like this one for responding to customer order inquiries, 0:43 it turns out that it&#39;s very difficult to know in advance what are the things that could 0:47 go wrong. 0:48 And so, rather than trying to build evaluations in advance, what I recommend is you just look 0:53 for the outputs and manually look for things that you wish it was doing better. 1:00 For example, maybe you read a lot of outputs and find that it is unexpectedly mentioning 1:05 your competitors more than it should. 1:08 Many businesses don&#39;t want their agents to mention competitors because it just creates 1:12 an awkward situation. 1:14 And if you read some of these outputs, maybe you find that it sometimes says, I&#39;m glad 1:17 you shopped with us. 1:18 We&#39;re much better than our competitor, ComproCo. 1:21 Or maybe sometimes they say, sure, it should be fun. 1:23 Unlike RivalCo, we make returns easy. 1:25 And you may look at this and go, gee, I really don&#39;t want this to mention competitors. 1:30 This is an example of a problem that is really hard to anticipate in advance of building 1:36 this agentic workflow. 1:37 So, the best practice is really to build it first and then examine it to figure out where 1:42 it is not yet satisfactory, and then to find ways to evaluate as well as improve the system 1:47 to eliminate the ways that it is still not yet satisfactory. 1:51 Assuming your business considers it an error or a mistake to mention competitors 1:57 in this way, then as you work on eliminating these competitor mentions, one way to track 2:02 progress is to add an evaluation or an eval to track how often this error occurs. 2:08 So, if you have a named list of competitors like ComproCo, RivalCo, the other co, then 2:14 you can actually write code to just search in your own output for how often it mentions 2:20 these competitors by name and count up as a number, as a fraction of the overall responses, 2:26 how frequently it mistakenly mentions competitors. 2:29 One nice thing about the problem of competitor mentions is it&#39;s an objective metric, meaning 2:35 either the competitor was mentioned or not. 2:38 And for objective criteria, you can write code to check for how often this specific 2:44 error occurs. 2:46 But because LLMs output free text, there are also going to be criteria by which you want 2:51 to evaluate this output that may be more subjective and where it&#39;s harder to just write code 2:57 to output a black and white score. 2:59 In this case, using a LLM as a judge is a common technique to evaluate the output. 3:05 So, for example, if you&#39;re building a research agent to do research on different topics, 3:10 then you can use another LLM and prompt it to maybe, say, assign the following essay 3:16 a quality score between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best essay. 3:21 Here, I&#39;m using a Python expression to mean copy-paste the generated essay into this. 3:27 So, you can prompt the LLM to read the essay and assign it a quality score. 3:32 Then I&#39;m going to ask the research agent to write a number of different research reports, 3:37 for example, on recent developments in black hole science or using robots to harvest fruit. 3:43 And then in this example, maybe the judge LLM assigns the essay on black holes a score 3:48 of 3, the essay on robot harvesting a score of 4, and as you work on improving your research 3:54 agent, hopefully you see these scores go up over time. 3:58 It turns out, by the way, that LLMs are actually not that good at these 1 to 5 scale ratings. 4:03 You can give it a shot, but I personally tend not to use this technique that much myself. 4:08 But in a later module, you&#39;ll learn some better techniques to have an LLM output more accurate 4:13 scores than asking it to output scores on a 1 to 5 scale, although some people will 4:17 do this, maybe an initial cut as an LLM as judge type of eval. 4:22 Just to give a preview of some of the Agentic AI evals you&#39;ll learn about later in this course, 4:28 you&#39;ve already heard me talk about how you can write codes to evaluate objective criteria, 4:33 such as did it mention a competitor or not, or use an LLM as a judge for more subjective 4:37 criteria such as what&#39;s the quality of this essay. 4:39 But later, you learn about two major types of evals. 4:42 One is end-to-end, where you measure the output quality of the entire agent, as well as component 4:48 level evals, where you might measure the quality of the output of a single step in the agentic 4:53 workflow. 4:54 It turns out that these are useful for driving different parts of your development process. 4:58 One thing I do a lot as well is just examine the intermediate outputs, or sometimes we 5:03 call these the traces of the LLM, in order to understand where it is falling short of 5:09 my expectations. 5:10 And we call this error analysis, where we just read through the intermediate outputs 5:14 of every single step to try to spot opportunities for improvement. 5:17 And it turns out being able to do evals and error analysis is a really key skill. 5:22 So we have much more to say about this in the fourth module in this course. 5:27 We&#39;re nearly to the end of this first module. 5:29 Before moving on, I just want to share with you what I think are the most important design 5:33 patterns for building agentic workflows. 5:35 Let&#39;s go take a look at that in the next video. 1.7 Agentic design patterns 0:04 We build agentic workflows by taking building blocks and putting them together to sequence 0:04 out these complex workflows. In this video, I&#39;d like to share with you a few of the key design 0:10 patterns, which are patterns for how you can think about combining these building blocks into more 0:16 complex workflows. Let&#39;s take a look. I think four key design patterns for building agentic 0:21 workflows are reflection, two-use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration. Let me briefly go over 0:27 what they mean, and then we&#39;ll actually go through most of these in-depth latent discourse as well. 0:33 The first of the major design patterns is reflection. So I might go to an LLM agent and 0:39 ask it to write code, and it turns out that an LLM might then generate code like this. It defines 0:45 here a Python function to do a certain task. I could then construct a prompt that looks like this. 0:50 I can say, here&#39;s code intended for a certain task, and then copy-paste whatever the LLM had 0:55 just output back into this prompt. And then I ask it to check the code carefully for correctness, 0:59 style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism. And it turns out that the same LLM model 1:03 prompted this way may be able to point out some problems with the code. And if I then take this 1:09 critique and feed it back to the model to say, looks like this is a bug, could you change the 1:15 code to fix it? Then it may actually come with a better version of the code. To give a preview of 1:21 tool use, if you&#39;re able to run the code and see where the code fails, then feeding that back to 1:28 the LLM can also cause it to be able to iterate and generate a much better, say, v3 version 3 of the 1:35 code. So reflection is a common design pattern where you can ask the LLM to examine its own outputs 1:41 or maybe bring in some external sources of information, such as run the code and see if it 1:46 generates any error messages, and use that as feedback to iterate again and come up with a better 1:52 version of its output. And this design pattern isn&#39;t magic. It does not result in everything 1:58 working 100% of the time. But sometimes it can be a nice bump in the performance of your system. 2:03 Now, I&#39;ve drawn this as if it was a single LLM that I&#39;m prompting, but to foreshadow multi-agent 2:09 workflows, you can also imagine instead of having the same model critique itself, you can imagine 2:15 having a critique agent. And all that is, is an LLM that&#39;s been prompted with instructions like, 2:20 your role is to critique code, here&#39;s code intended for a task, check the code carefully, and so on. 2:25 And the second critique agent, maybe point out errors or run unit tests. And by having two 2:31 simulated agents where each agent is just an LLM prompted to take on a certain persona, 2:36 you can have them go back and forth to iterate to get a better output. In addition to reflection 2:42 pattern, the second important design pattern is tool use. Where today, LLMs can be given tools, 2:49 meaning functions that they can call in order to get work done. For example, if you ask an LLM, 2:54 what&#39;s the best coffee maker according to reviewers, and you give it a web search tool, 2:58 then it can actually search the internet to find much better answers. Or a code execution tool. 3:03 If you ask a math question like, if I invest $100 in compound interest, what do I have at the end? 3:08 It can then write code and execute code to compute an answer. Today, different developers 3:13 have given LLMs many different tools for everything from math or data analysis to gather information 3:19 by fetching things from the web or for various databases, to interface with productivity apps 3:24 like email, calendar, and so on, as well as to process images and much more. And the ability 3:30 of an LLM to decide what tools to use, meaning what functions to call, that lets the model get a lot 3:37 more done. The third of the four design patterns is planning. This is an example from a paper 3:43 called Hugging GPT, in which if you ask a system to please generate an image where a girl is reading 3:51 a book and a pose is the same as a boy in the image, then please describe the new image in 3:54 your voice. Then a model can automatically decide that to carry out this task, it first needs to 4:00 find a pose determination model to figure out the pose of the boy. Then to pose the image, 4:05 to generate a picture of a girl and image the text, and then finally text the speech. And so 4:10 in planning, an LLM decides what is the sequence of actions it needs to take. In this case, it is 4:17 a sequence of API calls so that it can then carry out the right sequence of steps in the right order 4:23 in order to carry out the task. So rather than the developer hard coding the sequence of steps 4:29 in advance, this actually lets the LLM decide what are the steps to take. Agents that plan today are 4:36 harder to control and somewhat more experimental, but sometimes they can give really delightful 4:40 results. And then finally, multi-agent workflows. Just as a human manager might hire a number of 4:47 others to work together on a complex project, in some cases it might make sense for you to hire 4:52 a set of multiple agents, maybe each of which specializes in a different role, and have them 4:58 work together to accomplish a complex task. The picture you see here on the left is taken from a 5:03 project called ChatDev, which is a software framework created by Chen Qian and collaborators. 5:09 In ChatDev, multiple agents with different roles, like chief executive officer, programmer, tester, 5:15 designer, and so on, collaborate together as if they were a virtual software company and can 5:22 collaboratively complete a range of software development tasks. Let&#39;s consider another example. 5:28 If you want to write a marketing brochure, maybe you think of hiring a team of three people, such 5:33 as a researcher to do online research, a marketer to write the marketing text, and then finally an 5:39 editor to edit and polish the text. And so in a similar way, you might consider building a multi-agent 5:47 workflow in which you have a simulated research agent, a simulated marketer agent, and a simulated 5:53 editor agent that then come together to carry out this task for you. Multi-agent workflows are 6:00 more difficult to control since you don&#39;t always know ahead of time what the agents will do, but 6:05 research has shown that they can result in better outcomes for many complex tasks, including things 6:11 like writing biographies or deciding on chess moves to make in the game. You learn more about 6:16 multi-agent workflows later in this course as well. And so with that, I hope you have a sense of what 6:21 agentic workflows can do, as well as of what are the key challenges of finding building blocks and 6:27 putting them together, maybe via these design patterns, in order to implement an agentic workflow. 6:33 And of course, also developing eval so you can see how well your system is doing and keep on improving 6:39 on it. In the next module, I&#39;d like to share with you a deep dive into the first of these design 6:46 patterns, that is reflection, and you find that it&#39;s a maybe surprisingly simple to implement 6:53 technique that can give the performance of your system sometimes a very nice bump. So let&#39;s go on 6:59 to the next module to learn about the reflection design pattern.

When I coined the term agentic to describe what I saw 0:05 as an important and rapidly growing trend in how people were building on-base applications, 0:10 what I did not realize was that a bunch of marketers would get hold of this term 0:14 and use it as a sticker and put this on almost everything in sight. And that has caused hype 0:20 on Agentic AI to skyrocket. The good news though is that ignoring the hype, the number of truly 0:27 valuable and useful applications built using Agentic AI has also grown very rapidly, even if 0:33 not quite as rapidly as the hype. And in this course, what I&#39;d like to do is show you best 0:38 practices for building Agentic AI applications. And this will open up a lot of new opportunities 0:44 to you in terms of what you can now build. Today, agentic workflows are being used to build 0:49 applications like customer support agents, or to do deep research to help write deeply insightful 0:55 research reports, or to process tricky legal documents, or to look at patient input and render 1:02 or to suggest possible medical diagnoses. On many of my teams, a lot of the projects we built just 1:08 would be impossible without agentic workflows. And so knowing how to build applications with them 1:14 is one of the most important and valuable skills in AI today. It turns out that one of the biggest 1:20 differences I&#39;ve seen between people that really know how to build agentic workflows compared to 1:24 people that are less effective at it is the ability to drive a disciplined development process, 1:30 specifically one focused on evals and error analysis. And in this course, I&#39;ll tell you what 1:35 that means and show you what allows you to be really good at building these agentic workflows. 1:41 Being able to do this is one of the most important skills in AI today and will open up a lot more 1:46 opportunities, be it job opportunities or opportunities to just build amazing software 1:51 yourself. With that, let&#39;s go on to the next video to dive more into what are agentic workflows. 1.1 What is an agentic AI 0:03 So what is Agentic AI and why are Agentic AI workflows so powerful? Let&#39;s take a look. 0:05 The way that many of us use large language models or LLMs today is by prompting it to say, 0:11 write an essay for us on a certain topic X. And I think of that as akin to going to a human, 0:17 or in this case, going to an AI and asking it to please type out an essay for me by writing 0:22 from the first word to the last word all in one go and without ever using backspace. 0:27 It turns out that we as people, we don&#39;t do our best writing like that by being forced to write 0:32 in this completely linear order and nor do AI models. But despite the difficulty of being 0:38 constrained to write in this way, our LLMs do surprisingly well. In contrast, with an agentic 0:43 workflow, this is what the process might look like. You may ask it to first write an essay 0:48 outline on a certain topic, then ask if it needs to do any web research. And after doing some web 0:53 research and maybe downloading some web pages, then to write the first draft and then to read 0:57 the first draft and see what parts need revision or more research and then revise the draft and so 1:02 on. And this type of workflow is more akin to doing some thinking and some research and then 1:06 doing some revision and then doing some more thinking and so on. And with this iterative 1:12 process, it turns out that an agentic workflow can take longer, but it delivers a much better 1:18 work product. So an agentic AI workflow is a process where an LLM based app executes multiple 1:25 steps to complete a task. In this example, you might use an LLM to write the first essay outline 1:31 and then you might use an LLM to decide what search terms to type into a web search engine or 1:37 really what search terms to call a web search API with in order to get back relevant web pages. 1:44 Based on that, you can feed the downloaded web pages into an LLM to have it write the first draft 1:51 and then maybe use another LLM to reflect and decide what needs more revision. And then depending 1:57 on how you design this workflow, perhaps you may even add a human in the loop step where the LLM 2:03 has the option to request human review, maybe of some key facts. And based on that, it may then 2:10 revise the draft and this process results in a much better work output. One of the key skills 2:16 you learn in this course is how to take a complex task like writing an essay and breaking it down 2:24 into smaller steps for agentic workflows to execute one step at a time to then get the work output 2:31 that you want. And knowing how to decompose the task into steps and how to build the components 2:36 to execute the individual steps well turns out to be a tricky but important skill that will 2:42 determine your ability to build agentic workflows for a huge range of exciting applications. In this 2:48 course, a running example that we&#39;ll use and something that you build alongside me is a research 2:54 agent. So here&#39;s an example of what it will look like. You can enter a research topic like how do I 3:00 build a new rocket company to compete with SpaceX. I don&#39;t personally want to compete with SpaceX, 3:08 but if you want to, you can try asking a research agent to help your background research. 3:13 So this agent starts with planning out what research to use, including calling a web search 3:20 engine to download some web pages, and then to synthesize and rank findings, draft an outline, 3:26 have an editor-to-agent review for coherence, and then finally generate a comprehensive 3:30 markdown report, which it has done here, building a new rocket company to compete with SpaceX 3:35 with an intro, background, findings, and so on. I think it points out appropriately that 3:41 this is going to be a tough startup to build, so I&#39;m not personally planning to do this, but if 3:47 you want to tackle something like this, maybe a research agent like this could help you with some 3:53 initial research. And by finding and downloading multiple sources and deeply thinking about it, 4:00 this actually ends up with a much more thoughtful report than just prompting an LLM to write an essay 4:07 for you would. One of the reasons I&#39;m excited about this is because in my work, I&#39;ve ended up 4:12 building quite a few specialized research agents, be it in legal documents for conflict legal 4:18 compliance, or for some healthcare sectors, or some business product research areas. And so I hope 4:24 that working through this example, you not only learn how to build agentic workflows for many 4:29 other applications, but that some of the ideas in building research agents will be directly useful 4:34 to you if you ever need to build a custom research agent yourself. Now, one of the often discussed 4:42 areas of AI agents is how autonomous are they? What you just saw here was a relatively complex, 4:49 highly autonomous Agentic AI workflow, but there are also other simpler workflows that are 4:55 incredibly valuable. Let&#39;s go on to the next video to talk about the degree to which agentic 5:00 workflows can be autonomous, and does it give you a framework to think about how 5:05 you might go about building different applications and how easy or difficult they might be. 5:10 See you in the next video. 1.2 Degrees of autonomy 0:02 Agents can be autonomous to different degrees. A few years ago, I noticed within the AI community 0:06 that there was a growing controversial debate about what is an agent, and some people are 0:10 writing a paper saying I built an agent, and others will say, no, that&#39;s not really a true 0:14 agent. And I felt this debate was unnecessary, which is why I started using the term agentic, 0:21 because I thought if we use it as an adjective rather than a binary, it&#39;s either an agent or not, 0:26 then we&#39;re going to have to acknowledge that systems can be agentic to different degrees. 0:31 And let&#39;s just call it all agentic and move on with the real work of building these systems 0:36 rather than debating, you know, is this sufficiently autonomous to be an agent or not? 0:40 I remember when I prepared a talk on agentic reasoning, one of my team members actually 0:46 came to me and said, hey, Andrew, we don&#39;t need yet another word. You know, we have agent, 0:50 why are you making up another word, agentic? But I decided to use it anyway. And then later on, 0:55 wrote an article in a given newsletter, The Batch, and then also posted on social media, 1:01 saying that instead of arguing over which word to include or exclude as being a true agent, 1:06 let&#39;s acknowledge that different degrees to which systems can be agentic. And I think this helped 1:11 move past the debate on what is a true agent and let us just focus on actually building them. 1:18 Some agents can be less autonomous. So take the example of writing an essay about black holes. 1:25 You can have a relatively simple agent to come up with a few web search terms or web search queries. 1:31 Then you can hard code in that you call a web search engine, fetch some web pages, 1:37 and then use that to write an essay. And this is an example of a less autonomous agent 1:41 with a fully deterministic sequence of steps. And this will work okay. 1:46 In terms of notational convention, throughout this course, I&#39;ll use the red color, 1:50 as you see here on the left, to denote the user input, such as a user query in this case, 1:56 or in later examples, maybe the input document into an agentic workflow. 2:00 The gray boxes denote calls to an LLM, and the green boxes, like the web search and the web 2:07 fetch boxes that you see here, indicate steps where other software is being used to carry out 2:13 an action, such as a web search API call or executing code to fetch the contents of a website. 2:18 Then an agent can be more autonomous, where, given a request to write an essay about black holes, 2:24 perhaps you let the LLM decide, does it want to do a web search, or does it want to search 2:29 recent news sources, or does it want to search for recent research papers on the website archive? 2:34 Based on that, maybe in this example, the LLM, not the human engineer, but the LLM chooses, 2:39 in this case, to call a web search engine, and then after that, you may let the LLM decide 2:44 how many web pages does it want to fetch, or if it fetches the PDF, does it need to 2:50 call a function, or also call a tool, to convert the PDF to text? 2:53 And in this case, maybe it fetches its top few web pages, then it can write an essay, 2:59 decide whether to reflect and improve, and maybe even go back to fetch more web pages, 3:03 and then to finally produce an output. 3:06 And so even for this example of a research agent, we can see that some agents can be 3:13 less autonomous, with a linear sequence of steps to be executed, determined by a programmer, 3:18 and some can be more autonomous, where you trust the LLM to make more decisions, 3:22 and the exact sequence of steps that happens may be even determined by the LLM, rather than 3:26 in advance by the programmer. 3:28 So for less autonomous systems, you will usually have all the steps predetermined in advance, 3:34 and any functions it calls, like web search, and we&#39;ll call that tool use, as you learn 3:38 in the third module in this course, might be hard-coded by the human engineer, by you 3:43 or me, and most of the autonomy is in what text the LLM generates. 3:47 At the end of the spectrum would be highly autonomous agents, where the agent makes many 3:51 decisions autonomously, including, for example, deciding what is the sequence of steps it 3:56 will carry out in order to write the essay. 3:59 And there&#39;s some highly autonomous agents that can even write new functions, or sometimes 4:04 create new tools that it can then execute. 4:06 And somewhere in between are semi-autonomous agents, where it can make some decisions, 4:11 choose tools, but the tools are usually more predefined. 4:14 As you look at different examples in this course, you learn how to build applications 4:18 anywhere on this spectrum of less to more highly autonomous, and you find that there 4:22 are tons of applications in the less autonomous end of the spectrum that are very valuable 4:26 being built for tons of businesses today, and at the same time, there are also applications 4:31 being worked on at the more highly autonomous end of the spectrum, but those are usually 4:36 less easily controllable, a little bit more unpredictable, and also a lot of active research 4:42 as well to figure out how to build these more highly autonomous agents. 4:46 And with that, let&#39;s go on to the next video to dive deeper into this and to hear about 4:53 some of the benefits of using agents and why they allow us to do things that just were 4:57 not possible with earlier generations of base applications. 1.3 Benefits of agentic workflows 0:03 I think the one biggest benefit of agentic workflows is that it allows you to do many 0:04 tasks effectively that just previously were not possible. But there are other benefits as well, 0:10 including parallelism that lets you do certain things quite fast, as well as modularity that 0:14 lets you combine the best of three components from many different places to build an effective 0:19 workflow. Let&#39;s take a look. My team collected some data on a coding benchmark that tests the 0:26 ability of different LLMs to write code to carry out certain tasks. The benchmark used in this case 0:32 is called Human Eval, and it turns out that GPT 3.5, this is a model that the first publicly 0:38 available version of Chat GPT was based on, if asked to write the code directly, to just type 0:42 out the computer program, gets 40% right on this benchmark. This is a positive k-metric. GPT 4 is 0:49 a much better model. Its performance leaps to 67% with this also non-agentic workflow. But it turns 0:56 out that as large as the improvement was from GPT 3.5 to GPT 4, that improvement is dwarfed by what 1:03 you can achieve by wrapping GPT 3.5 within an agentic workflow. Using different agentic techniques, 1:10 which you&#39;ll learn about later in this course, you can prompt GPT 3.5 to write code and then maybe 1:15 reflect on the code and figure out if you can improve it. And using techniques like that, you can 1:20 actually get GPT 3.5 to get much higher levels of performance. And similarly, GPT 4 used in the 1:26 context of an agentic workflow also does much better. So even with today&#39;s best LLMs, an agentic 1:33 workflow lets you get much better performance. And in fact, what we saw in this example was the 1:39 improvement from one generation of model to another, which is huge, is still not as big a difference 1:45 as implementing an agentic workflow on the previous generation of model. Another benefit of 1:51 using agentic workflows is that they can parallelize some tasks and thus do certain things much faster 1:57 than a human. For example, if you ask an agentic workflow to write an essay about black holes, you 2:04 might be able to have three LLMs run in parallel to generate ideas for web search terms to type 2:10 into the search engine. Based on the first web search, it may identify, say, three top results to 2:16 fetch. And based on the second web search, it may identify a second set of web pages to fetch and so 2:22 on. And it turns out that whereas a human doing this research would have to read these nine web 2:28 pages sequentially or one at a time, when you&#39;re using an agentic workflow, you can actually 2:33 parallelize all nine web page downloads and then finally feed all these things into an LLM to write 2:39 an essay. So even though agentic workflows do take longer than truly non-agentic workflows or by 2:45 direct generation by just prompting a single time, if you were to compare this type of agentic 2:51 workflow to how a human would have to go about the task, the ability to parallelize downloading lots 2:56 of web pages can actually let it do certain tasks much faster than the non-parallel sequential way 3:02 that a single human might process this data. To build on this example, it turns out one of the 3:08 things I often do when building agentic workflows is look at the individual components like the LLM 3:14 and add or swap out components. So for example, maybe I look at the web search engine I use up 3:20 here and I might decide that I want to soften a new web search engine. When building agentic 3:24 workflows, there are actually multiple web search engines including Google, which you can access 3:29 by a server, as well as others like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Tavily, u.com. There are actually quite a lot of 3:35 options for web search engines designed for LLMs to use. Or maybe instead of just doing three web 3:40 searches, maybe on this step we can swap in a new news search engine so we can find out what&#39;s the 3:47 latest news on recent breakthroughs on black hole science. And lastly, instead of using the same LLM 3:55 for all of the different steps, I will often try out different large language models and maybe try 4:01 out different LLM providers to see which one gives the best result for different steps of this system. 4:07 So to summarize, the main reason I use agentic workflows is it just gives much better performance 4:13 on many different applications. But in addition, it can also paralyze some tasks that humans would 4:20 otherwise have to do sequentially. And the modular design of many agentic workflows also lets us 4:27 add or update tools and sometimes swap out models. We&#39;ve talked a lot about the key components of 4:33 building agentic workflows. Let&#39;s now take a look at a range of Agentic AI applications to give you 4:39 a sense of the sorts of things people are already building and the sorts of things 4:43 you&#39;ll build yourself. Let&#39;s go on to the next video. 1.4 Agentic AI applications 0:00 Let&#39;s take a look at some examples of Agentic AI applications. 0:04 One task that many businesses carry out is invoice processing. 0:09 So given an invoice like this, you might want to write software to extract the most important 0:14 fields, which for this application, let&#39;s say is the biller, that would be tech flow solutions, 0:19 the biller address, the amount due, which is $3,000, and the due date, which looks like it is 0:25 August 20th, 2025. So in many finance departments, maybe a human would look at invoices and identify 0:33 the most important fields, who do we need to pay by when, and record these in a database to make 0:39 sure that payment is issued in time. If you were to implement this with an agentic workflow, 0:44 you might do so like this. You write input an invoice, then call a PDF to text conversion API 0:51 to turn the PDF into maybe formatted text, such as markdown text for the LLM to ingest. Then the LLM 0:57 will look at the PDF and figure out, is this actually an invoice or is this some other type 1:02 of document that they should just ignore? And if it is an invoice, then it will pull up the required 1:07 fields as well as use an API or use a tool to update the database in order to save the most 1:14 important fields in the database records. So one aspect of this agentic workflow is that 1:20 there is a clear process to follow, is identify the required fields and record in the database. 1:26 Tasks like these with a clear process you want followed tend to be maybe easier for agentic 1:31 workflows to carry out because it leads to a relatively step-by-step way to reliably carry 1:36 out this task. Here&#39;s another example, maybe just a little bit harder. So if you want to build an 1:41 agent to respond to basic customer order inquiries, then the steps might be to extract the key 1:48 information, so figure out what exactly did the customer order, what&#39;s the customer&#39;s name, then 1:53 look up the relevant customer records, and then finally draft a response for human to review before 2:00 the email response is sent to the customer. So again, there&#39;s a clear process here and we 2:04 will implement this step-by-step, where we take the email, feed it to an LLM to verify or to extract 2:10 the order details, and assuming the customer email is about an order, the LLM might then choose to 2:16 call an order&#39;s database to then pull up that information. That information then goes to the LLM 2:22 to then draft an email response, and the LLM might choose to use a request review tool that, say, puts 2:29 this draft email from the LLM into queue for humans to review, so they can then be sent out after a 2:34 human has reviewed and approved it. So customer order inquiry agents like these are being built 2:40 and deployed in many businesses today. To look at a more challenging example, if you want to build a 2:45 customer service agent to respond not just to questions about an order they place, but to respond 2:51 to a more general set of questions, anything a customer may ask, and maybe the customer will ask, 2:57 do you have any black jeans or blue jeans? And to answer this question, you need to maybe make 3:03 multiple API calls to your database to first check the inventory for black jeans, then check inventory 3:08 for blue jeans, and then respond to the customer. So this is an example of a more challenging query, 3:14 where given a user input, you actually have to plan out what is the sequence of database queries 3:19 to check for inventory. Or if a user asks, I&#39;d like to return the beach towel I bought, then to answer 3:25 this, maybe we need to verify that the customer actually bought a beach towel, and then double 3:31 check the return policy. Maybe our set returns only 30 days within the date of purchase, and only the 3:36 towel was unused. And if return is allowed, then have the agent issue a return packing slip, and 3:42 also set the database record to return pending. So in this example, if the required steps to process 3:48 the customer requests are not known ahead of time, then it results in a more challenging process, 3:54 where the LLM base application has to decide for itself that these are the three steps needed in 4:00 order to respond appropriately to this task. But you learn about some of the latest work on how to 4:06 approach this type of problem too. And to give one last example of maybe an especially difficult 4:12 type of agent to build, there&#39;s a lot of work on computer use by agents, in which agents will 4:17 attempt to use a web browser and read a web page to figure out how to carry out a complex task. 4:24 In this example, I&#39;ve asked an agent to check whether seats are available on two specific United 4:30 Airlines flights from San Francisco to Washington DC, or the DCA airport. The agent has access to 4:36 a web browser they can use to carry out this task. And in the video here, you can see it navigating 4:41 the United website independently, clicking on page elements and filling in the text fields on the page 4:46 to carry out the search that I requested. As it works, the agent reasons over the content of the 4:52 page to figure out the actions it needs to take to complete the task, and what it should do next. 4:57 In this case, there&#39;s some trouble checking flights on the United site, and instead decides to 5:02 navigate to the Google Flights website to search for available flights. On the Google Flight, you 5:08 see here it finds several flight options that match the user&#39;s query, and the agent then picks one and 5:13 is taken back to the United website, where it looks like it&#39;s now on the correct web page, and so is 5:20 able to determine that yes, there are seats available on the flights that I asked about. So computer use 5:26 is an exciting cutting-edge area of research right now, and many companies are trying to get computer 5:30 use agents to work. While the agent you saw here did eventually figure out the answer, I often see 5:36 agents having trouble using web browsers well. For example, if a web page is slow to load, an agent 5:42 may fail to understand what&#39;s going on, and many web pages are still beyond agents&#39; abilities to 5:47 pause or to read accurately. But I think computer use agents, even though not yet reliable enough 5:53 to use mission-critical applications today, are an exciting and important area of future development. 5:58 So when I&#39;m considering building Agentic AI workflows, the tasks that are easier will tend to be ones 6:05 where there is a clear step-by-step process, or if a business already has a standard procedure, a 6:11 standard offering procedure to follow, and then it can be quite a lot of work to take that procedure 6:15 and codify it up in an AI agent, but that tends to lead to easier implementations. One thing that 6:21 makes it easier is if you are using text-only assets, because LLM/language models have 6:27 grown up really processing text, and if you need to process other input modalities, it may well be 6:33 doable, but it maybe gets a little bit harder. And on the harder end of the spectrum, if the steps are 6:38 not known ahead of time of what&#39;s needed to carry out a task, like you saw for the more advanced 6:42 customer service agent, then the agent may need to plan or solve as you go, and this tends to be 6:47 harder and more unpredictable and less reliable. And then as mentioned, if it needs to accept rich 6:52 multi-modal inputs such as sound, vision, audio, that also tends to be less reliable than the 6:58 only header process text. So I hope that gives you a sense of the types of applications you might build 7:05 with agentic workflows. When implementing one of these things yourself, one of the most important 7:10 skills is to look at a complex workflow and figure out what are the individual steps so you can 7:16 implement an agentic workflow to execute those steps one at a time. In the next video, we&#39;ll talk 7:22 about task decomposition, that is, given a complex thing you want to do, like write a research report 7:28 or have a customer agent get back to customers, how do you break that down into discrete steps 7:34 to try to implement an agentic workflow? Let&#39;s go see that in the next video. 1.5 Task decomposition: Identifying the steps in a workflow 0:00 People and businesses do a lot of stuff. How do you take this useful stuff that we do 0:06 and break it down into discrete steps for the agentic workflow to follow? Let&#39;s take a look. 0:12 Take the example of building a research agent. If you want an AI system to write an essay on 0:18 a topic X, one thing you could do is prompt an LLM to have it generate an output directly. 0:24 But if you were to do this for topics that you want deeply researched, 0:28 you may find that the LLM output covers only the surface level points, or maybe covers only the 0:33 obvious facts, but doesn&#39;t go as deep into the subject as you want it to. In this case, you 0:39 might then reflect on how you as a human would write an essay on a certain topic. Would you just 0:45 sit down and start writing, or would you take multiple steps, such as first write an essay 0:50 outline, and then search the rep, and then based on the input from the web search, write the essay. 0:55 As I take a task and decompose it into steps, one question I&#39;m always asking myself is, 1:00 if I look at these steps one, two, and three, can each of them be done either by an LLM, or 1:07 by a short piece of code, or by a function call, or by a tool. In this case, I think an LLM can 1:13 maybe write a decent outline on many topics that I would want it to help me think through. So, 1:20 say probably okay on the first step, and then I know how to use an LLM to generate search terms 1:26 to search the web. So, I would say the second step is also doable, and then based on web search, 1:31 I think an LLM could input the web search results and write an essay. And so, this would be a 1:35 reasonable first attempt at an agentic workflow for writing an essay that goes deeper than just 1:41 direct generation. But if I were to then implement this agentic workflow and look at the results, 1:47 maybe you find that the results still aren&#39;t good enough. It&#39;s still not yet as deeply thoughtful. 1:51 Maybe the essays feel a little bit disjointed. This has actually happened to me. I once built 1:56 a research agent using this workflow, but when I read the output, it felt a bit disjointed. 2:00 You know, the start of the article didn&#39;t feel completely consistent with the middle, 2:04 didn&#39;t feel completely consistent with the end. In this case, what you might do is then reflect 2:09 on how you would change the workflow if you as a human found that the essay is a little bit 2:13 disjointed. One thing you could do is take the third step and further decompose, write the essay 2:21 into additional steps. So, instead of writing the essay on one go, you might instead have it 2:27 write the first draft, and then consider what parts need revision, and then revise the draft. 2:32 And this would be how I as a human might go about it, to not just write the final essay at my first 2:39 attempt, but write the first draft and then read over it, which is another step that the LLM is 2:44 pretty decent at. And then based on my own critique of my own essay, I&#39;ll revise the draft. 2:49 So to recap, I started off with direct generation, just one step, decided it wasn&#39;t good enough, 2:55 and so broke that down into three steps, and then maybe decided that still isn&#39;t good enough, 3:00 and took one of the steps and further broken it down or decomposed it into three more steps, 3:05 resulting in this more complex, richer process for generating an essay. And depending on how 3:12 satisfied you are with the results of this process, you may choose to even modify this essay 3:18 generation process further. Let&#39;s look at the second example of how to decompose complex tasks 3:23 into smaller steps. Take the example of responding to basic customer order inquiries. The first step 3:30 that a human customer specialization might carry out might be to first extract the key information, 3:36 such as who is this email from, what did they order, and what is the order number. And these 3:41 are things that an LLM could do. So I could just say, let&#39;s have an LLM do that. The second step 3:46 would be to then find the relevant customer records. So to write and generate the relevant 3:51 database queries to pull up the order of what the customer had ordered and when I shipped and so on. 3:56 I think an LLM with the ability to call a function to query the orders database should be able to do 4:04 that. And lastly, having pulled up the customer record or the customer order record, I might then 4:09 write and send a response back to the customer. And I think with the information we pulled up, 4:13 this third step is also doable with an LLM if I give the option to call an API to send an email. 4:19 So this would be another example of taking a task of responding to customer email and breaking it 4:25 down into three individual steps where I can look at each of these steps and say, yep, I think an LLM 4:30 or one LLM with the ability to call a function to query a database or send an email should be able 4:35 to do that. Just one last example for the invoice processing. After a PDF invoice has been converted 4:42 to text, the first step is to pull out the required information, the name of the biller, the address, 4:47 the due date, the amount due, and so on. And now I should be able to do that. And then if I want to 4:53 check that the information was extracted and save it in a new database entry, then I think an LLM 4:58 should be able to help me call a function to update the database record. And so to implement this, 5:04 we implement an agentic workflow to carry out basically these two steps. When building agentic 5:09 workflows, I think of myself as having a number of building blocks. One important building block 5:15 would be large language models or maybe large multimodal models if I want to try to process 5:20 images or audio as well. And LLMs are good at generating text, deciding what to call, 5:25 maybe extracting information. For some highly specialized tasks, I might also use some other 5:31 AI models, such as an AI model for converting a PDF to text or for text-to-speech or for image 5:38 analysis. In addition to AI models, I also have access to a number of software tools, including 5:45 different APIs that I can call to do voice search, to get maybe real-time weather data, 5:51 to send emails, check calendar, and so on. And I might also have tools to retrieve information, 5:57 to pull up data from a database, or to invent RAG or retrieval augmented generation, 6:03 where I can look up a large text database and find the most relevant text. Or I might also 6:07 have tools to execute code. And this is a tool that lets an LLM write code and then run the code 6:13 on your computer to do a huge range of things. In case some of these tools seem a bit foreign to 6:18 you, don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ll go through the most important tools in much greater detail in 6:23 a later module. But I think of a lot of my work when I&#39;m building an agent workflow as looking at 6:29 the work that the person or business is doing and then trying to figure out with these building 6:33 blocks, how can I sequence these building blocks together in order to carry out the tasks that I 6:39 want my system to carry out. And this is why having a good understanding of what building 6:44 blocks are available, which I hope you have a better sense of by the end of this course as well, 6:49 will allow you to better envision what agentic workflows you can build by combining these 6:54 building blocks together. So to summarize, one of the key skills in building agentic workflows is 6:59 to look at a bunch of stuff that maybe someone does and to identify the discrete steps that 7:06 it could be implemented with. And when I&#39;m looking at the individual discrete steps, 7:10 one question I&#39;m always asking myself is, can this step be implemented with either an 7:16 LLM or with one of the tools such as an API or a function call that I have access to? And in case 7:22 the answer is no, I&#39;ll then often ask myself, how would I as a human do this step? And is it 7:28 possible to decompose this further or break this down into even smaller steps that then maybe is 7:34 more amenable to implementation with an LLM or with one of the software tools that I have? 7:40 So I hope this gives you a rough sense of how to think about task decomposition. In case you feel 7:45 like you don&#39;t fully have it yet, don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ll go through many more examples 7:50 in this course and you have a much better understanding of this by the end of this 7:54 course. But it turns out that as you build agentic workflows, you find that often you 7:59 build an initial task decomposition, initial agentic workflow, and then you want to keep 8:05 on iterating and improving on it quite a few times until it delivers the level of performance 8:10 that you want. And to drive this improvement process, which I found important for many 8:15 projects, one of the key skills is to know how to evaluate your agentic workflow. So in the next 8:21 video, we&#39;ll talk about evaluations or evals and discrete key components, how you can build, 8:28 and then also keep on improving your workflows to get the performance 8:31 that you want. Let&#39;s talk about evals in the next video. 1.6 Evaluations agentic (evals) 0:04 I&#39;ve worked with many different teams on building agentic workflows, and I&#39;ve found that one 0:05 of the biggest predictors for whether someone is able to do it really well versus be less 0:10 efficient at it is whether or not they&#39;re able to drive a really disciplined evaluation 0:16 process. 0:17 So, your ability to drive evals for your agentic workflow makes a huge difference in your ability 0:23 to build them effectively. 0:26 In this video, we&#39;ll take a quick overview of how to build evals, and this is a subject 0:30 that we&#39;ll actually go into much deeper in a later module in this course. 0:35 So, let&#39;s take a look. 0:37 After building an agentic workflow like this one for responding to customer order inquiries, 0:43 it turns out that it&#39;s very difficult to know in advance what are the things that could 0:47 go wrong. 0:48 And so, rather than trying to build evaluations in advance, what I recommend is you just look 0:53 for the outputs and manually look for things that you wish it was doing better. 1:00 For example, maybe you read a lot of outputs and find that it is unexpectedly mentioning 1:05 your competitors more than it should. 1:08 Many businesses don&#39;t want their agents to mention competitors because it just creates 1:12 an awkward situation. 1:14 And if you read some of these outputs, maybe you find that it sometimes says, I&#39;m glad 1:17 you shopped with us. 1:18 We&#39;re much better than our competitor, ComproCo. 1:21 Or maybe sometimes they say, sure, it should be fun. 1:23 Unlike RivalCo, we make returns easy. 1:25 And you may look at this and go, gee, I really don&#39;t want this to mention competitors. 1:30 This is an example of a problem that is really hard to anticipate in advance of building 1:36 this agentic workflow. 1:37 So, the best practice is really to build it first and then examine it to figure out where 1:42 it is not yet satisfactory, and then to find ways to evaluate as well as improve the system 1:47 to eliminate the ways that it is still not yet satisfactory. 1:51 Assuming your business considers it an error or a mistake to mention competitors 1:57 in this way, then as you work on eliminating these competitor mentions, one way to track 2:02 progress is to add an evaluation or an eval to track how often this error occurs. 2:08 So, if you have a named list of competitors like ComproCo, RivalCo, the other co, then 2:14 you can actually write code to just search in your own output for how often it mentions 2:20 these competitors by name and count up as a number, as a fraction of the overall responses, 2:26 how frequently it mistakenly mentions competitors. 2:29 One nice thing about the problem of competitor mentions is it&#39;s an objective metric, meaning 2:35 either the competitor was mentioned or not. 2:38 And for objective criteria, you can write code to check for how often this specific 2:44 error occurs. 2:46 But because LLMs output free text, there are also going to be criteria by which you want 2:51 to evaluate this output that may be more subjective and where it&#39;s harder to just write code 2:57 to output a black and white score. 2:59 In this case, using a LLM as a judge is a common technique to evaluate the output. 3:05 So, for example, if you&#39;re building a research agent to do research on different topics, 3:10 then you can use another LLM and prompt it to maybe, say, assign the following essay 3:16 a quality score between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best essay. 3:21 Here, I&#39;m using a Python expression to mean copy-paste the generated essay into this. 3:27 So, you can prompt the LLM to read the essay and assign it a quality score. 3:32 Then I&#39;m going to ask the research agent to write a number of different research reports, 3:37 for example, on recent developments in black hole science or using robots to harvest fruit. 3:43 And then in this example, maybe the judge LLM assigns the essay on black holes a score 3:48 of 3, the essay on robot harvesting a score of 4, and as you work on improving your research 3:54 agent, hopefully you see these scores go up over time. 3:58 It turns out, by the way, that LLMs are actually not that good at these 1 to 5 scale ratings. 4:03 You can give it a shot, but I personally tend not to use this technique that much myself. 4:08 But in a later module, you&#39;ll learn some better techniques to have an LLM output more accurate 4:13 scores than asking it to output scores on a 1 to 5 scale, although some people will 4:17 do this, maybe an initial cut as an LLM as judge type of eval. 4:22 Just to give a preview of some of the Agentic AI evals you&#39;ll learn about later in this course, 4:28 you&#39;ve already heard me talk about how you can write codes to evaluate objective criteria, 4:33 such as did it mention a competitor or not, or use an LLM as a judge for more subjective 4:37 criteria such as what&#39;s the quality of this essay. 4:39 But later, you learn about two major types of evals. 4:42 One is end-to-end, where you measure the output quality of the entire agent, as well as component 4:48 level evals, where you might measure the quality of the output of a single step in the agentic 4:53 workflow. 4:54 It turns out that these are useful for driving different parts of your development process. 4:58 One thing I do a lot as well is just examine the intermediate outputs, or sometimes we 5:03 call these the traces of the LLM, in order to understand where it is falling short of 5:09 my expectations. 5:10 And we call this error analysis, where we just read through the intermediate outputs 5:14 of every single step to try to spot opportunities for improvement. 5:17 And it turns out being able to do evals and error analysis is a really key skill. 5:22 So we have much more to say about this in the fourth module in this course. 5:27 We&#39;re nearly to the end of this first module. 5:29 Before moving on, I just want to share with you what I think are the most important design 5:33 patterns for building agentic workflows. 5:35 Let&#39;s go take a look at that in the next video. 1.7 Agentic design patterns 0:04 We build agentic workflows by taking building blocks and putting them together to sequence 0:04 out these complex workflows. In this video, I&#39;d like to share with you a few of the key design 0:10 patterns, which are patterns for how you can think about combining these building blocks into more 0:16 complex workflows. Let&#39;s take a look. I think four key design patterns for building agentic 0:21 workflows are reflection, two-use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration. Let me briefly go over 0:27 what they mean, and then we&#39;ll actually go through most of these in-depth latent discourse as well. 0:33 The first of the major design patterns is reflection. So I might go to an LLM agent and 0:39 ask it to write code, and it turns out that an LLM might then generate code like this. It defines 0:45 here a Python function to do a certain task. I could then construct a prompt that looks like this. 0:50 I can say, here&#39;s code intended for a certain task, and then copy-paste whatever the LLM had 0:55 just output back into this prompt. And then I ask it to check the code carefully for correctness, 0:59 style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism. And it turns out that the same LLM model 1:03 prompted this way may be able to point out some problems with the code. And if I then take this 1:09 critique and feed it back to the model to say, looks like this is a bug, could you change the 1:15 code to fix it? Then it may actually come with a better version of the code. To give a preview of 1:21 tool use, if you&#39;re able to run the code and see where the code fails, then feeding that back to 1:28 the LLM can also cause it to be able to iterate and generate a much better, say, v3 version 3 of the 1:35 code. So reflection is a common design pattern where you can ask the LLM to examine its own outputs 1:41 or maybe bring in some external sources of information, such as run the code and see if it 1:46 generates any error messages, and use that as feedback to iterate again and come up with a better 1:52 version of its output. And this design pattern isn&#39;t magic. It does not result in everything 1:58 working 100% of the time. But sometimes it can be a nice bump in the performance of your system. 2:03 Now, I&#39;ve drawn this as if it was a single LLM that I&#39;m prompting, but to foreshadow multi-agent 2:09 workflows, you can also imagine instead of having the same model critique itself, you can imagine 2:15 having a critique agent. And all that is, is an LLM that&#39;s been prompted with instructions like, 2:20 your role is to critique code, here&#39;s code intended for a task, check the code carefully, and so on. 2:25 And the second critique agent, maybe point out errors or run unit tests. And by having two 2:31 simulated agents where each agent is just an LLM prompted to take on a certain persona, 2:36 you can have them go back and forth to iterate to get a better output. In addition to reflection 2:42 pattern, the second important design pattern is tool use. Where today, LLMs can be given tools, 2:49 meaning functions that they can call in order to get work done. For example, if you ask an LLM, 2:54 what&#39;s the best coffee maker according to reviewers, and you give it a web search tool, 2:58 then it can actually search the internet to find much better answers. Or a code execution tool. 3:03 If you ask a math question like, if I invest $100 in compound interest, what do I have at the end? 3:08 It can then write code and execute code to compute an answer. Today, different developers 3:13 have given LLMs many different tools for everything from math or data analysis to gather information 3:19 by fetching things from the web or for various databases, to interface with productivity apps 3:24 like email, calendar, and so on, as well as to process images and much more. And the ability 3:30 of an LLM to decide what tools to use, meaning what functions to call, that lets the model get a lot 3:37 more done. The third of the four design patterns is planning. This is an example from a paper 3:43 called Hugging GPT, in which if you ask a system to please generate an image where a girl is reading 3:51 a book and a pose is the same as a boy in the image, then please describe the new image in 3:54 your voice. Then a model can automatically decide that to carry out this task, it first needs to 4:00 find a pose determination model to figure out the pose of the boy. Then to pose the image, 4:05 to generate a picture of a girl and image the text, and then finally text the speech. And so 4:10 in planning, an LLM decides what is the sequence of actions it needs to take. In this case, it is 4:17 a sequence of API calls so that it can then carry out the right sequence of steps in the right order 4:23 in order to carry out the task. So rather than the developer hard coding the sequence of steps 4:29 in advance, this actually lets the LLM decide what are the steps to take. Agents that plan today are 4:36 harder to control and somewhat more experimental, but sometimes they can give really delightful 4:40 results. And then finally, multi-agent workflows. Just as a human manager might hire a number of 4:47 others to work together on a complex project, in some cases it might make sense for you to hire 4:52 a set of multiple agents, maybe each of which specializes in a different role, and have them 4:58 work together to accomplish a complex task. The picture you see here on the left is taken from a 5:03 project called ChatDev, which is a software framework created by Chen Qian and collaborators. 5:09 In ChatDev, multiple agents with different roles, like chief executive officer, programmer, tester, 5:15 designer, and so on, collaborate together as if they were a virtual software company and can 5:22 collaboratively complete a range of software development tasks. Let&#39;s consider another example. 5:28 If you want to write a marketing brochure, maybe you think of hiring a team of three people, such 5:33 as a researcher to do online research, a marketer to write the marketing text, and then finally an 5:39 editor to edit and polish the text. And so in a similar way, you might consider building a multi-agent 5:47 workflow in which you have a simulated research agent, a simulated marketer agent, and a simulated 5:53 editor agent that then come together to carry out this task for you. Multi-agent workflows are 6:00 more difficult to control since you don&#39;t always know ahead of time what the agents will do, but 6:05 research has shown that they can result in better outcomes for many complex tasks, including things 6:11 like writing biographies or deciding on chess moves to make in the game. You learn more about 6:16 multi-agent workflows later in this course as well. And so with that, I hope you have a sense of what 6:21 agentic workflows can do, as well as of what are the key challenges of finding building blocks and 6:27 putting them together, maybe via these design patterns, in order to implement an agentic workflow. 6:33 And of course, also developing eval so you can see how well your system is doing and keep on improving 6:39 on it. In the next module, I&#39;d like to share with you a deep dive into the first of these design 6:46 patterns, that is reflection, and you find that it&#39;s a maybe surprisingly simple to implement 6:53 technique that can give the performance of your system sometimes a very nice bump. So let&#39;s go on 6:59 to the next module to learn about the reflection design pattern. "><meta name="twitter:image" content="http://localhost:1355/img/Linguista_imresizer.png">

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Welcome to this course on Agentic AI. When I coined the term agentic to describe what I saw
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:05
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>as an important and rapidly growing trend in how people were building on-base applications,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:10
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>what I did not realize was that a bunch of marketers would get hold of this term
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:14
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>and use it as a sticker and put this on almost everything in sight. And that has caused hype
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:20
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on Agentic AI to skyrocket. The good news though is that ignoring the hype, the number of truly
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:27
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>valuable and useful applications built using Agentic AI has also grown very rapidly, even if
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:33
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>not quite as rapidly as the hype. And in this course, what I&#39;d like to do is show you best
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:38
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>practices for building Agentic AI applications. And this will open up a lot of new opportunities
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:44
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to you in terms of what you can now build. Today, agentic workflows are being used to build
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:49
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>applications like customer support agents, or to do deep research to help write deeply insightful
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:55
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>research reports, or to process tricky legal documents, or to look at patient input and render
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:02
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>or to suggest possible medical diagnoses. On many of my teams, a lot of the projects we built just
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:08
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>would be impossible without agentic workflows. And so knowing how to build applications with them
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:14
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>is one of the most important and valuable skills in AI today. It turns out that one of the biggest
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:20
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>differences I&#39;ve seen between people that really know how to build agentic workflows compared to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:24
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>people that are less effective at it is the ability to drive a disciplined development process,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:30
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>specifically one focused on evals and error analysis. And in this course, I&#39;ll tell you what
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:35
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that means and show you what allows you to be really good at building these agentic workflows.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:41
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Being able to do this is one of the most important skills in AI today and will open up a lot more
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:46
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>opportunities, be it job opportunities or opportunities to just build amazing software
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:51
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>yourself. With that, let&#39;s go on to the next video to dive more into what are agentic workflows.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So what is Agentic AI <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> why are Agentic AI workflows so powerful<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span> Let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s take a look.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">05</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>The way that many of us use large language models <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> LLMs today is by prompting it to say,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>write an essay <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> us on a certain topic X<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And I think of that as akin to going to a human,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">17</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, going to an AI <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> asking it to please type out an essay <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> me by writing
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>from the first word to the last word all <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> one go <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> without ever using backspace<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">27</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It turns out that we as people, we don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t do our best writing like that by being forced to write</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">32</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this completely linear order <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> nor <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> AI models<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But despite the difficulty of being
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">38</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>constrained to write <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this way, our LLMs <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> surprisingly well<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In contrast, with an agentic
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">43</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflow, this is what the process might look like<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> You may ask it to first write an essay
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">48</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>outline on a certain topic, then ask <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> it needs to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> any web research<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And after doing some web
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>research <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> maybe downloading some web pages, then to write the first draft <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then to read
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">57</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the first draft <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> see what parts need revision <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> more research <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then revise the draft <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">02</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And this type of workflow is more akin to doing some thinking <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> some research <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">06</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>doing some revision <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then doing some more thinking <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And with this iterative
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>process, it turns out that an agentic workflow can take longer, but it delivers a much better
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">18</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>work product<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So an agentic AI workflow is a process where an LLM based app executes multiple
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>steps to complete a task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In this example, you might use an LLM to write the first essay outline
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then you might use an LLM to decide what search terms to type into a web search engine <span style="color:#f92672">or</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">37</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>really what search terms to call a web search API with <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to get back relevant web pages<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">44</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Based on that, you can feed the downloaded web pages into an LLM to have it write the first draft
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then maybe use another LLM to reflect <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> decide what needs more revision<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then depending
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">57</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on how you design this workflow, perhaps you may even add a human <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the loop step where the LLM
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>has the option to request human review, maybe of some key facts<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And based on that, it may then
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>revise the draft <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> this process results <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a much better work output<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> One of the key skills
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you learn <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this course is how to take a complex task like writing an essay <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> breaking it down
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>into smaller steps <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> agentic workflows to execute one step at a time to then get the work output
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that you want<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And knowing how to decompose the task into steps <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> how to build the components
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to execute the individual steps well turns out to be a tricky but important skill that will
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>determine your ability to build agentic workflows <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> a huge range of exciting applications<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In this

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>course, a running example that we<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll use and something that you build alongside me is a research</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">54</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>agent<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So here<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s an example of what it will look like. You can enter a research topic like how do I</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>build a new rocket company to compete with SpaceX<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> I don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t personally want to compete with SpaceX,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">08</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>but <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you want to, you can try asking a research agent to help your background research<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So this agent starts with planning out what research to use, including calling a web search
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>engine to download some web pages, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then to synthesize <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> rank findings, draft an outline,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">26</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>have an editor<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>to<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agent review <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> coherence, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then finally generate a comprehensive
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>markdown report, which it has done here, building a new rocket company to compete with SpaceX
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">35</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>with an intro, background, findings, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> I think it points out appropriately that
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>this is going to be a tough startup to build, so I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m not personally planning to do this, but if</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you want to tackle something like this, maybe a research agent like this could help you with some
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>initial research<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And by finding <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> downloading multiple sources <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> deeply thinking about it,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>this actually ends up with a much more thoughtful report than just prompting an LLM to write an essay
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">07</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> you would<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> One of the reasons I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m excited about this is because in my work, I&#39;</span>ve ended up
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>building quite a few specialized research agents, be it <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> legal documents <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> conflict legal

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that working through this example, you <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> only learn how to build agentic workflows <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> many

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Agents can be autonomous to different degrees<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> A few years ago, I noticed within the AI community
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">06</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that there was a growing controversial debate about what is an agent, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> some people are
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>writing a paper saying I built an agent, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> others will say, no, that<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s not really a true</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">14</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>agent<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And I felt this debate was unnecessary, which is why I started using the term agentic,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">21</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>because I thought <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> we use it as an adjective rather than a binary, it<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s either an agent or not,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">26</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>then we<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;re going to have to acknowledge that systems can be agentic to different degrees.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s just call it all agentic and move on with the real work of building these systems</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>rather than debating, you know, is this sufficiently autonomous to be an agent <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#f92672">not</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">40</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I remember when I prepared a talk on agentic reasoning, one of my team members actually
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">46</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>came to me <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> said, hey, Andrew, we don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t need yet another word. You know, we have agent,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>why are you making up another word, agentic<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span> But I decided to use it anyway<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then later on,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">55</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>wrote an article <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a given newsletter, The Batch, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then also posted on social media,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">01</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>saying that instead of arguing over which word to include <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> exclude as being a true agent,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">06</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s acknowledge that different degrees to which systems can be agentic. And I think this helped</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>move past the debate on what is a true agent <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> let us just focus on actually building them<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">18</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Some agents can be less autonomous<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So take the example of writing an essay about black holes<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>You can have a relatively simple agent to come up with a few web search terms <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> web search queries<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Then you can hard code <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> that you call a web search engine, fetch some web pages,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">37</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then use that to write an essay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And this is an example of a less autonomous agent
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>with a fully deterministic sequence of steps<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And this will work okay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">46</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>In terms of notational convention, throughout this course, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll use the red color,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>as you see here on the left, to denote the user input, such as a user query <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">56</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> later examples, maybe the input document into an agentic workflow<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>The gray boxes denote calls to an LLM, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> the green boxes, like the web search <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> the web
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">07</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>fetch boxes that you see here, indicate steps where other software is being used to carry out
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>an action, such as a web search API call <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> executing code to fetch the contents of a website<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">18</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Then an agent can be more autonomous, where, given a request to write an essay about black holes,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>perhaps you let the LLM decide, does it want to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> a web search, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> does it want to search
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">29</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>recent news sources, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> does it want to search <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> recent research papers on the website archive<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">34</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Based on that, maybe <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this example, the LLM, <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> the human engineer, but the LLM chooses,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">39</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, to call a web search engine, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then after that, you may let the LLM decide
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">44</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>how many web pages does it want to fetch, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> it fetches the PDF, does it need to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>call a function, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> also call a <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span>, to convert the PDF to text<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, maybe it fetches its top few web pages, then it can write an essay,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">59</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>decide whether to reflect <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> improve, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> maybe even go back to fetch more web pages,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then to finally produce an output<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">06</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And so even <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> this example of a research agent, we can see that some agents can be
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>less autonomous, with a linear sequence of steps to be executed, determined by a programmer,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">18</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> some can be more autonomous, where you trust the LLM to make more decisions,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> the exact sequence of steps that happens may be even determined by the LLM, rather than
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">26</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> advance by the programmer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">28</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> less autonomous systems, you will usually have all the steps predetermined <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> advance,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">34</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> any functions it calls, like web search, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> we<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll call that tool use, as you learn</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">38</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the third module <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this course, might be hard<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>coded by the human engineer, by you
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">43</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">or</span> me, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> most of the autonomy is <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> what text the LLM generates<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>At the end of the spectrum would be highly autonomous agents, where the agent makes many
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>decisions autonomously, including, <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> example, deciding what is the sequence of steps it
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">56</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>will carry out <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to write the essay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>improvement from one generation of model to another, which is huge, is still <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> as big a difference

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>using agentic workflows is that they can parallelize some tasks <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> thus <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> certain things much faster

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>might be able to have three LLMs run <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> parallel to generate ideas <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> web search terms to type

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>fetch<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And based on the second web search, it may identify a second set of web pages to fetch <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And it turns out that whereas a human doing this research would have to read these nine web

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>pages sequentially <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> one at a time, when you<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;re using an agentic workflow, you can actually</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>parallelize all nine web page downloads <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then finally feed all these things into an LLM to write

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>an essay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So even though agentic workflows <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> take longer than truly non<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agentic workflows <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> by

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of web pages can actually let it <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> certain tasks much faster than the non<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>parallel sequential way

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that a single human might process this data<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> To build on this example, it turns out one of the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">08</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>things I often <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> when building agentic workflows is look at the individual components like the LLM
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">14</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> add <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> swap out components<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> example, maybe I look at the web search engine I use up
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>here <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> I might decide that I want to soften a new web search engine<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> When building agentic
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflows, there are actually multiple web search engines including Google, which you can access
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">29</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>by a server, as well as others like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Tavily, u<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>com<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> There are actually quite a lot of
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">35</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>options <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> web search engines designed <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> LLMs to use<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Or maybe instead of just doing three web
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">40</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>searches, maybe on this step we can swap <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a new news search engine so we can find out what<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s the</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>latest news on recent breakthroughs on black hole science<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And lastly, instead of using the same LLM
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">55</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> all of the different steps, I will often try out different large language models <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> maybe try
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">01</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>out different LLM providers to see which one gives the best result <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> different steps of this system<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">07</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So to summarize, the main reason I use agentic workflows is it just gives much better performance
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on many different applications<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> addition, it can also paralyze some tasks that humans would

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>otherwise have to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> sequentially<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And the modular design of many agentic workflows also lets us
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">27</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>add <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> update tools <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> sometimes swap out models<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> We<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ve talked a lot about the key components of</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to turn the PDF into maybe formatted text, such as markdown text <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> the LLM to ingest<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Then the LLM
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">57</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>will look at the PDF <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> figure out, is this actually an invoice <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> is this some other type
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">02</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of document that they should just ignore<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span> And <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> it is an invoice, then it will pull up the required
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">07</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>fields as well as use an API <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> use a <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span> to update the database <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to save the most
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">14</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>important fields <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the database records<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So one aspect of this agentic workflow is that
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>there is a clear process to follow, is identify the required fields <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> record <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the database<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">26</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Tasks like these with a clear process you want followed tend to be maybe easier <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> agentic
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflows to carry out because it leads to a relatively step<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>by<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>step way to reliably carry
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>out this task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Here<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s another example, maybe just a little bit harder. So if you want to build an</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>agent to respond to basic customer order inquiries, then the steps might be to extract the key
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">48</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>information, so figure out what exactly did the customer order, what<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s the customer&#39;</span>s name, then
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>look up the relevant customer records, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then finally draft a response <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> human to review before
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the email response is sent to the customer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So again, there<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s a clear process here and we</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">04</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>will implement this step<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>by<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>step, where we take the email, feed it to an LLM to verify <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> to extract
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the order details, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> assuming the customer email is about an order, the LLM might then choose to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>call an order<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s database to then pull up that information. That information then goes to the LLM</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to then draft an email response, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> the LLM might choose to use a request review <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span> that, say, puts
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">29</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>this draft email from the LLM into queue <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> humans to review, so they can then be sent out after a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">34</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>human has reviewed <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> approved it<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So customer order inquiry agents like these are being built
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">40</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> deployed <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> many businesses today<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> To look at a more challenging example, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you want to build a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>customer service agent to respond <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> just to questions about an order they place, but to respond
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to a more general set of questions, anything a customer may ask, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> maybe the customer will ask,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">57</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> you have any black jeans <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> blue jeans<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span> And to answer this question, you need to maybe make
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>multiple API calls to your database to first check the inventory <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> black jeans, then check inventory
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">08</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> blue jeans, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then respond to the customer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So this is an example of a more challenging query,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">14</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>where given a user input, you actually have to plan out what is the sequence of database queries
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to check <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> inventory<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Or <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> a user asks, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;d like to return the beach towel I bought, then to answer</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>this, maybe we need to verify that the customer actually bought a beach towel, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then double
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>check the <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> policy<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Maybe our set returns only <span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span> days within the date of purchase, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> only the

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>also set the database record to <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> pending<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this example, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> the required steps to process
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">48</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the customer requests are <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> known ahead of time, then it results <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a more challenging process,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">54</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>where the LLM base application has to decide <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> itself that these are the three steps needed <span style="color:#f92672">in</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>order to respond appropriately to this task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But you learn about some of the latest work on how to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">06</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>approach this type of problem too<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And to give one last example of maybe an especially difficult
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>type of agent to build, there<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s a lot of work on computer use by agents, in which agents will</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">17</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>attempt to use a web browser <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> read a web page to figure out how to carry out a complex task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>In this example, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ve asked an agent to check whether seats are available on two specific United</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Airlines flights from San Francisco to Washington DC, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> the DCA airport<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> The agent has access to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a web browser they can use to carry out this task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the video here, you can see it navigating
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the United website independently, clicking on page elements <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> filling <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the text fields on the page
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">46</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to carry out the search that I requested<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> As it works, the agent reasons over the content of the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">52</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>page to figure out the actions it needs to take to complete the task, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> what it should <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> next<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">57</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>In this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, there<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s some trouble checking flights on the United site, and instead decides to</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">02</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>navigate to the Google Flights website to search <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> available flights<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> On the Google Flight, you
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">08</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>see here it finds several flight options that match the user<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s query, and the agent then picks one and</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>is taken back to the United website, where it looks like it<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s now on the correct web page, and so is</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>able to determine that yes, there are seats available on the flights that I asked about<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So computer use
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">26</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>is an exciting cutting<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>edge area of research right now, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> many companies are trying to get computer
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>use agents to work<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> While the agent you saw here did eventually figure out the answer, I often see
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>agents having trouble using web browsers well<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> For example, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> a web page is slow to load, an agent
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>may fail to understand what<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s going on, and many web pages are still beyond agents&#39;</span> abilities to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>pause <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> to read accurately<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But I think computer use agents, even though <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> yet reliable enough
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to use mission<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>critical applications today, are an exciting <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> important area of future development<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">58</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So when I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m considering building Agentic AI workflows, the tasks that are easier will tend to be ones</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">05</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>where there is a clear step<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>by<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>step process, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> a business already has a standard procedure, a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>standard offering procedure to follow, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then it can be quite a lot of work to take that procedure
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> codify it up <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> an AI agent, but that tends to lead to easier implementations<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> One thing that
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">21</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>makes it easier is <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you are using text<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>only assets, because LLM<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>language models have
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">27</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>grown up really processing text, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you need to process other input modalities, it may well be
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>doable, but it maybe gets a little bit harder<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And on the harder end of the spectrum, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> the steps are
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">38</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">not</span> known ahead of time of what<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s needed to carry out a task, like you saw for the more advanced</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>customer service agent, then the agent may need to plan <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> solve as you go, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> this tends to be
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>harder <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> more unpredictable <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> less reliable<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then as mentioned, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> it needs to accept rich
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">52</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>multi<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>modal inputs such as sound, vision, audio, that also tends to be less reliable than the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">58</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>only header process text<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So I hope that gives you a sense of the types of applications you might build
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">05</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>with agentic workflows<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> When implementing one of these things yourself, one of the most important
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>skills is to look at a complex workflow <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> figure out what are the individual steps so you can
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>implement an agentic workflow to execute those steps one at a time<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In the next video, we<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll talk</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>about task decomposition, that is, given a complex thing you want to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>, like write a research report
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">28</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Take the example of building a research agent<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> If you want an AI system to write an essay on
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">18</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a topic X, one thing you could <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> is prompt an LLM to have it generate an output directly<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>But <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you were to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> this <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> topics that you want deeply researched,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">28</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you may find that the LLM output covers only the surface level points, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> maybe covers only the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>obvious facts, but doesn<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t go as deep into the subject as you want it to. In this case, you</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">39</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>might then reflect on how you as a human would write an essay on a certain topic<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Would you just
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sit down <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> start writing, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> would you take multiple steps, such as first write an essay
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>outline, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then search the rep, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then based on the input from the web search, write the essay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">55</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>As I take a task <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> decompose it into steps, one question I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m always asking myself is,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I look at these steps one, two, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> three, can each of them be done either by an LLM, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">07</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>by a short piece of code, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> by a function call, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> by a <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, I think an LLM can
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>maybe write a decent outline on many topics that I would want it to help me think through<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>say probably okay on the first step, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then I know how to use an LLM to generate search terms
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">26</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to search the web<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So, I would say the second step is also doable, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then based on web search,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I think an LLM could input the web search results <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> write an essay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And so, this would be a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">35</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>reasonable first attempt at an agentic workflow <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> writing an essay that goes deeper than just
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>direct generation<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I were to then implement this agentic workflow <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> look at the results,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>maybe you find that the results still aren<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t good enough. It&#39;</span>s still <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> yet as deeply thoughtful<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Maybe the essays feel a little bit disjointed<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> This has actually happened to me<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> I once built
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">56</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a research agent using this workflow, but when I read the output, it felt a bit disjointed<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>You know, the start of the article didn<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t feel completely consistent with the middle,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">04</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>didn<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t feel completely consistent with the end. In this case, what you might do is then reflect</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">09</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on how you would change the workflow <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you as a human found that the essay is a little bit
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>disjointed<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> One thing you could <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> is take the third step <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> further decompose, write the essay
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">21</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>into additional steps<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So, instead of writing the essay on one go, you might instead have it
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">27</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>write the first draft, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then consider what parts need revision, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then revise the draft<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">32</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And this would be how I as a human might go about it, to <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> just write the final essay at my first
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">39</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>attempt, but write the first draft <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then read over it, which is another step that the LLM is
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">44</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>pretty decent at<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then based on my own critique of my own essay, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll revise the draft.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">49</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So to recap, I started off with direct generation, just one step, decided it wasn<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t good enough,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">55</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so broke that down into three steps, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then maybe decided that still isn<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t good enough,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">and</span> took one of the steps <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> further broken it down <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> decomposed it into three more steps,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">05</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>resulting <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this more complex, richer process <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> generating an essay<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And depending on how
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>satisfied you are with the results of this process, you may choose to even modify this essay
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">18</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>generation process further<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s look at the second example of how to decompose complex tasks</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">23</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>into smaller steps<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Take the example of responding to basic customer order inquiries<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> The first step
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that a human customer specialization might carry out might be to first extract the key information,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>such as who is this email from, what did they order, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> what is the order number<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And these
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>are things that an LLM could <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So I could just say, let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s have an LLM do that. The second step</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">46</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>would be to then find the relevant customer records<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So to write <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> generate the relevant
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>database queries to pull up the order of what the customer had ordered <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> when I shipped <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">56</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I think an LLM with the ability to call a function to query the orders database should be able to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">04</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And lastly, having pulled up the customer record <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> the customer order record, I might then
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">09</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>write <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> send a response back to the customer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And I think with the information we pulled up,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>this third step is also doable with an LLM <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I give the option to call an API to send an email<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So this would be another example of taking a task of responding to customer email <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> breaking it
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>down into three individual steps where I can look at each of these steps <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> say, yep, I think an LLM
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">or</span> one LLM with the ability to call a function to query a database <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> send an email should be able
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">35</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> that<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Just one last example <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> the invoice processing<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> After a PDF invoice has been converted
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to text, the first step is to pull out the required information, the name of the biller, the address,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the due date, the amount due, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And now I should be able to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> that<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I want to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>check that the information was extracted <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> save it <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a new database entry, then I think an LLM
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">58</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>should be able to help me call a function to update the database record<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And so to implement this,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">04</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>we implement an agentic workflow to carry out basically these two steps<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> When building agentic
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">09</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflows, I think of myself as having a number of building blocks<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> One important building block
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>would be large language models <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> maybe large multimodal models <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I want to try to process
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>images <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> audio as well<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And LLMs are good at generating text, deciding what to call,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>maybe extracting information<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> For some highly specialized tasks, I might also use some other
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>AI models, such as an AI model <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> converting a PDF to text <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> text<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>to<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>speech <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> image
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">38</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>analysis<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In addition to AI models, I also have access to a number of software tools, including
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>different APIs that I can call to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> voice search, to get maybe real<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>time weather data,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to send emails, check calendar, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And I might also have tools to retrieve information,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">57</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to pull up data from a database, <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> to invent RAG <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> retrieval augmented generation,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>where I can look up a large text database <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> find the most relevant text<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Or I might also
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">07</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>have tools to execute code<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And this is a <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span> that lets an LLM write code <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then run the code
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you, don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;</span>ll go through the most important tools <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> much greater detail <span style="color:#f92672">in</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a later module<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But I think of a lot of my work when I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m building an agent workflow as looking at</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">29</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the work that the person <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> business is doing <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then trying to figure out with these building
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>blocks, how can I sequence these building blocks together <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to carry out the tasks that I
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">39</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>want my system to carry out<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And this is why having a good understanding of what building

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>blocks are available, which I hope you have a better sense of by the end of this course as well,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">49</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>will allow you to better envision what agentic workflows you can build by combining these
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">54</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>building blocks together<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So to summarize, one of the key skills <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> building agentic workflows is
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">59</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to look at a bunch of stuff that maybe someone does <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> to identify the discrete steps that
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">06</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>it could be implemented with<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And when I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m looking at the individual discrete steps,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>one question I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;m always asking myself is, can this step be implemented with either an</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>LLM <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> with one of the tools such as an API <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> a function call that I have access to<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span> And <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the answer is no, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll then often ask myself, how would I as a human do this step? And is it</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">28</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>possible to decompose this further <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">break</span> this down into even smaller steps that then maybe is
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">34</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>more amenable to implementation with an LLM <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> with one of the software tools that I have<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">40</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So I hope this gives you a rough sense of how to think about task decomposition<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span> you feel
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>like you don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t fully have it yet, don&#39;</span>t worry about it<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> We<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll go through many more examples</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>course<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But it turns out that as you build agentic workflows, you find that often you

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>build an initial task decomposition, initial agentic workflow, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then you want to keep

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:04
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I&#39;ve worked with many different teams on building agentic workflows, and I&#39;ve found that one
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:05
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of the biggest predictors for whether someone is able to do it really well versus be less
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:10
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>efficient at it is whether or not they&#39;re able to drive a really disciplined evaluation
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:16
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>process.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:17
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So, your ability to drive evals for your agentic workflow makes a huge difference in your ability
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:23
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to build them effectively.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:26
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>In this video, we&#39;ll take a quick overview of how to build evals, and this is a subject
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:30
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>that we&#39;ll actually go into much deeper in a later module in this course.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:35
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So, let&#39;s take a look.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:37
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>After building an agentic workflow like this one for responding to customer order inquiries,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:43
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>it turns out that it&#39;s very difficult to know in advance what are the things that could
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:47
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>go wrong.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:48
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And so, rather than trying to build evaluations in advance, what I recommend is you just look
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:53
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>for the outputs and manually look for things that you wish it was doing better.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:00
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>For example, maybe you read a lot of outputs and find that it is unexpectedly mentioning
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:05
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>your competitors more than it should.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:08
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Many businesses don&#39;t want their agents to mention competitors because it just creates
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:12
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>an awkward situation.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:14
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And if you read some of these outputs, maybe you find that it sometimes says, I&#39;m glad
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:17
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you shopped with us.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:18
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>We&#39;re much better than our competitor, ComproCo.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:21
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Or maybe sometimes they say, sure, it should be fun.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:23
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Unlike RivalCo, we make returns easy.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:25
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And you may look at this and go, gee, I really don&#39;t want this to mention competitors.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:30
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>This is an example of a problem that is really hard to anticipate in advance of building
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:36
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>this agentic workflow.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:37
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So, the best practice is really to build it first and then examine it to figure out where
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:42
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>it is not yet satisfactory, and then to find ways to evaluate as well as improve the system
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:47
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to eliminate the ways that it is still not yet satisfactory.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:51
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Assuming your business considers it an error or a mistake to mention competitors
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>1:57
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>in this way, then as you work on eliminating these competitor mentions, one way to track
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:02
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>progress is to add an evaluation or an eval to track how often this error occurs.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:08
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So, if you have a named list of competitors like ComproCo, RivalCo, the other co, then
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:14
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you can actually write code to just search in your own output for how often it mentions
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:20
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>these competitors by name and count up as a number, as a fraction of the overall responses,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:26
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>how frequently it mistakenly mentions competitors.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:29
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>One nice thing about the problem of competitor mentions is it&#39;s an objective metric, meaning
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:35
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>either the competitor was mentioned or not.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:38
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And for objective criteria, you can write code to check for how often this specific
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:44
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>error occurs.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:46
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>But because LLMs output free text, there are also going to be criteria by which you want
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:51
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to evaluate this output that may be more subjective and where it&#39;s harder to just write code
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:57
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to output a black and white score.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2:59
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>In this case, using a LLM as a judge is a common technique to evaluate the output.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:05
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So, for example, if you&#39;re building a research agent to do research on different topics,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:10
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>then you can use another LLM and prompt it to maybe, say, assign the following essay
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:16
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a quality score between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best essay.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:21
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Here, I&#39;m using a Python expression to mean copy-paste the generated essay into this.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:27
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So, you can prompt the LLM to read the essay and assign it a quality score.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:32
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Then I&#39;m going to ask the research agent to write a number of different research reports,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:37
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>for example, on recent developments in black hole science or using robots to harvest fruit.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:43
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And then in this example, maybe the judge LLM assigns the essay on black holes a score
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:48
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of 3, the essay on robot harvesting a score of 4, and as you work on improving your research
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:54
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>agent, hopefully you see these scores go up over time.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3:58
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It turns out, by the way, that LLMs are actually not that good at these 1 to 5 scale ratings.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:03
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>You can give it a shot, but I personally tend not to use this technique that much myself.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:08
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>But in a later module, you&#39;ll learn some better techniques to have an LLM output more accurate
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:13
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>scores than asking it to output scores on a 1 to 5 scale, although some people will
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:17
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>do this, maybe an initial cut as an LLM as judge type of eval.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:22
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Just to give a preview of some of the Agentic AI evals you&#39;ll learn about later in this course,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:28
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you&#39;ve already heard me talk about how you can write codes to evaluate objective criteria,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:33
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>such as did it mention a competitor or not, or use an LLM as a judge for more subjective
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:37
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>criteria such as what&#39;s the quality of this essay.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:39
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>But later, you learn about two major types of evals.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:42
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>One is end-to-end, where you measure the output quality of the entire agent, as well as component
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:48
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>level evals, where you might measure the quality of the output of a single step in the agentic
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:53
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflow.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:54
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It turns out that these are useful for driving different parts of your development process.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4:58
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>One thing I do a lot as well is just examine the intermediate outputs, or sometimes we
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:03
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>call these the traces of the LLM, in order to understand where it is falling short of
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:09
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>my expectations.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:10
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And we call this error analysis, where we just read through the intermediate outputs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:14
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of every single step to try to spot opportunities for improvement.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:17
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And it turns out being able to do evals and error analysis is a really key skill.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:22
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>So we have much more to say about this in the fourth module in this course.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:27
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>We&#39;re nearly to the end of this first module.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:29
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Before moving on, I just want to share with you what I think are the most important design
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5:33
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>patterns for building agentic workflows.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>here a Python function to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> a certain task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> I could then construct a prompt that looks like this<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I can say, here<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s code intended for a certain task, and then copy-paste whatever the LLM had</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">55</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>just output back into this prompt<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then I ask it to check the code carefully <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> correctness,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">59</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>style, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> efficiency, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> give constructive criticism<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And it turns out that the same LLM model
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>prompted this way may be able to point out some problems with the code<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I then take this
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">09</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>critique <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> feed it back to the model to say, looks like this is a bug, could you change the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>code to fix it<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span> Then it may actually come with a better version of the code<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> To give a preview of
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">21</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span> use, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;re able to run the code and see where the code fails, then feeding that back to</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">28</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>the LLM can also cause it to be able to iterate <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> generate a much better, say, v3 version <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span> of the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">35</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>code<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So reflection is a common design pattern where you can ask the LLM to examine its own outputs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">41</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">or</span> maybe bring <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> some external sources of information, such as run the code <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> see <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> it
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">46</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>generates any error messages, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> use that as feedback to iterate again <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> come up with a better
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">52</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>version of its output<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And this design pattern isn<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t magic. It does not result in everything</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">58</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>working <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span><span style="color:#f92672">%</span> of the time<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> But sometimes it can be a nice bump <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the performance of your system<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Now, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ve drawn this as if it was a single LLM that I&#39;</span>m prompting, but to foreshadow multi<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agent
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">09</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflows, you can also imagine instead of having the same model critique itself, you can imagine
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>having a critique agent<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And all that is, is an LLM that<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s been prompted with instructions like,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>your role is to critique code, here<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s code intended for a task, check the code carefully, and so on.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And the second critique agent, maybe point out errors <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> run unit tests<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And by having two
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">31</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>simulated agents where each agent is just an LLM prompted to take on a certain persona,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>you can have them go back <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> forth to iterate to get a better output<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In addition to reflection
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>pattern, the second important design pattern is <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span> use<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Where today, LLMs can be given tools,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">49</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>meaning functions that they can call <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to get work done<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> For example, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you ask an LLM,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">54</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>what<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s the best coffee maker according to reviewers, and you give it a web search tool,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">58</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>then it can actually search the internet to find much better answers<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Or a code execution <span style="color:#66d9ef">tool</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>If you ask a math question like, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> I invest <span style="color:#f92672">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span> <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> compound interest, what <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> I have at the end<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">08</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It can then write code <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> execute code to compute an answer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Today, different developers
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>have given LLMs many different tools <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> everything from math <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> data analysis to gather information
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>by fetching things from the web <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> various databases, to interface with productivity apps
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">24</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>like email, calendar, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on, as well as to process images <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> much more<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And the ability
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of an LLM to decide what tools to use, meaning what functions to call, that lets the model get a lot
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">37</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>more done<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> The third of the four design patterns is planning<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> This is an example from a paper
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">43</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>called Hugging GPT, <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> which <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you ask a system to please generate an image where a girl is reading
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">51</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a book <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> a pose is the same as a boy <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the image, then please describe the new image <span style="color:#f92672">in</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">54</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>your voice<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Then a model can automatically decide that to carry out this task, it first needs to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>find a pose determination model to figure out the pose of the boy<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Then to pose the image,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">05</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>to generate a picture of a girl <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> image the text, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then finally text the speech<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And so
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> planning, an LLM decides what is the sequence of actions it needs to take<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In this <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, it is
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">17</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a sequence of API calls so that it can then carry out the right sequence of steps <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the right order
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">23</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to carry out the task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So rather than the developer hard coding the sequence of steps
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">29</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">in</span> advance, this actually lets the LLM decide what are the steps to take<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Agents that plan today are
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">36</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>harder to control <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> somewhat more experimental, but sometimes they can give really delightful
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">40</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>results<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And then finally, multi<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agent workflows<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Just as a human manager might hire a number of
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>others to work together on a complex project, <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> some cases it might make sense <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> you to hire
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">52</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a set of multiple agents, maybe each of which specializes <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a different role, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> have them
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">58</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>work together to accomplish a complex task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> The picture you see here on the left is taken from a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">03</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>project called ChatDev, which is a software framework created by Chen Qian <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> collaborators<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">09</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>In ChatDev, multiple agents with different roles, like chief executive officer, programmer, tester,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>designer, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> so on, collaborate together as <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> they were a virtual software company <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> can
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>collaboratively complete a range of software development tasks<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s consider another example.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">28</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>If you want to write a marketing brochure, maybe you think of hiring a team of three people, such
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>as a researcher to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> online research, a marketer to write the marketing text, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> then finally an
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">39</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>editor to edit <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> polish the text<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And so <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> a similar way, you might consider building a multi<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agent
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">47</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>workflow <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> which you have a simulated research agent, a simulated marketer agent, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> a simulated
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>editor agent that then come together to carry out this task <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> you<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> Multi<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agent workflows are
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>more difficult to control since you don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t always know ahead of time what the agents will do, but</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">05</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>research has shown that they can result <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> better outcomes <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> many complex tasks, including things
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>like writing biographies <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> deciding on chess moves to make <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> the game<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> You learn more about
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>multi<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>agent workflows later <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> this course as well<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> And so with that, I hope you have a sense of what
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">21</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>agentic workflows can <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>, as well as of what are the key challenges of finding building blocks <span style="color:#f92672">and</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">27</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>putting them together, maybe via these design patterns, <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order to implement an agentic workflow<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>And of course, also developing eval so you can see how well your system is doing <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> keep on improving
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">39</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>on it<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> In the next module, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;d like to share with you a deep dive into the first of these design</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">46</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>patterns, that is reflection, <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> you find that it<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s a maybe surprisingly simple to implement</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>technique that can give the performance of your system sometimes a very nice bump<span style="color:#f92672">.</span> So let<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s go on</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>:<span style="color:#ae81ff">59</span>
