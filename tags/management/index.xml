      <title>Founder Mode</title>

Most founders I talked to afterward said it was the best they&amp;rsquo;d ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time in his life, forgot to take notes. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to try to reproduce it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theme of Brian&amp;rsquo;s talk was that the conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized as &amp;ldquo;hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.&amp;rdquo; He followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Maker&#39;s Schedule, Manager&#39;s Schedule</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;makers-schedule-managers-schedule&#34;&gt;Maker&amp;rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&amp;rsquo;s Schedule&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;July 2009&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;– Charles Dickens&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&amp;rsquo;re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of schedule, which I&amp;rsquo;ll call the manager&amp;rsquo;s schedule and the maker&amp;rsquo;s schedule. The manager&amp;rsquo;s schedule is for bosses. It&amp;rsquo;s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you&amp;rsquo;re doing every hour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Other Half of &#39;Artists Ship&#39;</title>

A startup walks like a toddler, bashing into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all suppliers to prove they&amp;rsquo;re solvent before submitting bids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Pooled-Risk Company Management Company</title>

Instead of hoping to get rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a &amp;ldquo;liquidity event,&amp;rdquo; founders should start companies that make money and live off the revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a good plan. Let&amp;rsquo;s think about the optimal way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Business Can Learn from Open Source</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1355/paul_graham/essays_en/opensource/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-business-can-learn-from-open-source&#34;&gt;What Business Can Learn from Open Source&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;August 2005&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2005.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lately companies have been paying more attention to open source. Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its monopoly to servers. It seems safe to say now that open source has prevented that. A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing Windows servers with Linux servers. [1]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 2008, rev. June 2008&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology tends to separate normal from natural. Our bodies weren&amp;rsquo;t designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise. There may be a similar problem with the way we work: a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
