&lt;p&gt;September 2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up. What was I? A student. To do that well meant to get good grades. Why did one have to get good grades? To get into a good college. And why did one want to do that? There seemed to be several reasons: you&amp;rsquo;d learn more, get better jobs, make more money. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter exactly what the benefits would be. College was a bottleneck through which all your future prospects passed; everything would be better if you went to a better college.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
