You need to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on elsewhere in mathematics, and what other mathematicians find interesting; this will often give valuable perspectives on your own work. This is true not just for talks in your immediate field, but also in nearby fields. (For much the same reason, I recommend studying at different places.) An inspiring talk can also increase your motivation in your own work and in the field of mathematics in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I&#39;ve Learned from Hacker News</title>

Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news. It&amp;rsquo;s grown bigger and taken up more time than I expected, but I don&amp;rsquo;t regret that because I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much from working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth&#34;&gt;Growth&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600 daily uniques. It&amp;rsquo;s since grown to around 22,000. This growth rate is a bit higher than I&amp;rsquo;d like. I&amp;rsquo;d like the site to grow, since a site that isn&amp;rsquo;t growing at least slowly is probably dead. But I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit—mainly because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Startup Hubs Work</title>

Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;October 2011&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude. Somehow it&amp;rsquo;s as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wondered about this for years. I could see the average town was like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people went in, but no startups came out. But I was never able to figure out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was killing all the potential startups. [1]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
