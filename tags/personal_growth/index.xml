      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/kids/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;having-kids&#34;&gt;Having Kids&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I&amp;rsquo;d have been sad to think I&amp;rsquo;d never have children. But did I want them now? No.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had kids, I&amp;rsquo;d become a parent, and parents, as I&amp;rsquo;d known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;d noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
