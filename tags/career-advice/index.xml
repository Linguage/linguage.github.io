      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/career-advice/career-advice.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn’t.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Jong&#34;&gt;Erica Jong&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is my collection of various pieces of advice on academic career issues in mathematics, roughly arranged by the stage of career at which the advice is most pertinent (though of course some of the advice pertains to multiple stages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: The advice here is very generic in nature; I don’t pretend to have any sort of “silver bullet” that will solve all career issues. You will of course need to evaluate many factors, contexts, and needs specific to your own situation, as well as employing a healthy dose of common sense, before making any important career decisions. I would in particular recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/career-advice/orig/talk-to-your-advisor/&#34;&gt;discussing such decisions with your advisor&lt;/a&gt; if you have one, as he or she will be familiar with your situation and will likely be able to provide pertinent advice. Also, it should be clear that most of this advice is targeted towards academic careers in mathematics; of course, there are many other career options available besides this, but I have no particularly informed advice to offer for such alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/college/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;undergraduation&#34;&gt;Undergraduation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 2005&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to me with questions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had several emails from computer science undergrads asking what to do in college. I might not be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in college. But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought I was one. I was certainly a hacker, at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
