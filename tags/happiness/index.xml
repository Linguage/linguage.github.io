      <title>Having Kids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/kids/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;having-kids&#34;&gt;Having Kids&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I&amp;rsquo;d have been sad to think I&amp;rsquo;d never have children. But did I want them now? No.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had kids, I&amp;rsquo;d become a parent, and parents, as I&amp;rsquo;d known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;d noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Do What You Love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_en/love/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/love/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-do-what-you-love&#34;&gt;How to Do What You Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;January 2006&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We&amp;rsquo;ve got it down to four words: &amp;ldquo;Do what you love.&amp;rdquo; But it&amp;rsquo;s not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn&amp;rsquo;t — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Top of My Todo List</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_en/todo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/todo/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-top-of-my-todo-list&#34;&gt;The Top of My Todo List&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2012&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the biggest regrets of the dying. Her list seems plausible. I could see myself — can see myself — making at least 4 of these 5 mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might be: don&amp;rsquo;t be a cog. The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Doesn&#39;t Seem Like Work?</title>

For most of my childhood he worked for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to do. When you talk to him about his childhood, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear watershed at about age 12, when he &amp;ldquo;got interested in maths.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of Pwllheli. As we retraced his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been nice growing up in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
