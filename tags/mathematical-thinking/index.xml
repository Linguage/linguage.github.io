This can be a rather different mindset than what one commonly sees in more &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; situations such as business, sports, engineering, or politics, where actual success or failure often matters much more than what one can salvage from a partial success. I think the basic reason for this is that in the purely theoretical world of mathematics, there is basically a zero cost in taking an argument that partially solves a problem, and then combining it with other ideas to make a complete solution; but in the real world, it can be difficult, costly, or socially unacceptable to reuse or recycle anything that is (or is perceived to be) even a partial failure. Software engineering is one of the few exceptions to this general rule, as it is almost as easy to reuse software code as it is to reuse a mathematical argument.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/career-advice/zh/learn-and-relearn-your-field.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;learn-and-relearn-your-field&#34;&gt;Learn and relearn your field&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even fairly good students, when they have obtained the solution of the problem and written down neatly the argument, shut their books and look for something else. Doing so, they miss an important and instructive phase of the work. … A good teacher should understand and impress on his students the view that no problem whatever is completely exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the first and foremost duties of the teacher is not to give his students the impression that mathematical problems have little connection with each other, and no connection at all with anything else. We have a natural opportunity to investigate the connections of a problem when looking back at its solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question &amp;lsquo;How can we eat?&amp;rsquo;, the second by the question &amp;lsquo;Why do we eat?&amp;rsquo; and the third by the question, &amp;lsquo;Where shall we have lunch?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
