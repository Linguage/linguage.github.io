&lt;p&gt;One of the secrets to mathematical problem solving is that one needs to place a high value on partial progress, as being a crucial stepping stone to fully solving the problem. This can be a rather different mindset than what one commonly sees in more &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; situations such as business, sports, engineering, or politics, where actual success or failure often matters much more than what one can salvage from a partial success. I think the basic reason for this is that in the purely theoretical world of mathematics, there is basically a zero cost in taking an argument that partially solves a problem, and then combining it with other ideas to make a complete solution; but in the real world, it can be difficult, costly, or socially unacceptable to reuse or recycle anything that is (or is perceived to be) even a partial failure. Software engineering is one of the few exceptions to this general rule, as it is almost as easy to reuse software code as it is to reuse a mathematical argument.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Learn and relearn your field</title><link>https://linguista.cn/terencetao/career-advice/orig/learn-and-relearn-your-field/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2007 18:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://linguista.cn/terencetao/career-advice/orig/learn-and-relearn-your-field/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linguista.cn/terencetao/career-advice/zh/learn-and-relearn-your-field.zh/"&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even fairly good students, when they have obtained the solution of the problem and written down neatly the argument, shut their books and look for something else. Doing so, they miss an important and instructive phase of the work. … A good teacher should understand and impress on his students the view that no problem whatever is completely exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>There’s more to mathematics than rigour and proofs</title><link>https://linguista.cn/terencetao/career-advice/orig/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2007 18:51:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://linguista.cn/terencetao/career-advice/orig/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linguista.cn/terencetao/career-advice/zh/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs.zh/"&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question &amp;lsquo;How can we eat?&amp;rsquo;, the second by the question &amp;lsquo;Why do we eat?&amp;rsquo; and the third by the question, &amp;lsquo;Where shall we have lunch?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
