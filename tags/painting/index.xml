      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/hp/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;hackers-and-painters&#34;&gt;Hackers and Painters&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May 2003&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This essay is derived from a guest lecture at Harvard, which incorporated an earlier talk at Northeastern.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I finished grad school in computer science I went to art school to study painting. A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work&amp;ndash; that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
