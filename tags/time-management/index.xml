At the time, I was mentioning how laborious it was for me to create a BibTeX file for dozens of references by using MathSciNet to locate each reference separately, and to export each one to BibTeX format. He then informed me that underneath to every MathSciNet reference there was a little link to add the reference to a Clipboard, and then one could export the entire Clipboard at once to whatever format one wished. In retrospect, this was a functionality of the site that had always been visible, but I had never bothered to explore it, and now I can populate a BibTeX file much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Talks are not the same as papers</title>

The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.&#xA;— William Ward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to give good talks, especially when one is just starting out one&amp;rsquo;s career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One should avoid the common error of treating a talk like a paper, with all the attendant details, technicalities, and formalism. (In particular, one should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; give a talk which consists solely of transparencies of one&amp;rsquo;s research paper!) Such talks are almost impossible for anyone not intimately familiar with your work to be able to follow, especially since (unlike when reading a paper) it is difficult for an audience member to refer back to notation that had been defined, or comments that had been made, four slides or five blackboards ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Be professional in your work</title>

Unless you are already on good casual terms with the person you are interacting with, send them an email (or text, if you are close enough to share phone numbers) to schedule a call or meeting rather than just showing up or calling unannounced. If you have an appointment, be on time; being too late or too early can disrupt your colleague&amp;rsquo;s other plans for the day and can also be viewed as a sign of disrespect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Once you have experienced it, you are eager to repeat it but unable to do it at will, unless perhaps by dogged work…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;André Weil, &amp;ldquo;The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relying on intelligence alone to pull things off at the last minute may work for a while, but, generally speaking, at the graduate level or higher it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
