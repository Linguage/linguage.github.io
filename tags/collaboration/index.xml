      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/zh/on-time-management.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-time-management&#34;&gt;On time management&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prodded by several comments, I have finally decided to write up some my thoughts on time management here. I actually have been drafting something about this subject for a while, but I soon realised that my own experience with time management is still very much a work in progress (you should see my backlog of papers that need writing up) and I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have a coherent or definitive philosophy on this topic (other than my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;advice on writing papers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;page on rapid prototyping&lt;/a&gt;). Also, I can only talk about my own personal experiences, which probably do not generalise to all personality types or work situations, though perhaps readers may wish to contribute their own thoughts, experiences, or suggestions in the comments here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this way he steadily raises his level of aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kurt Lewin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among chess players, it is generally accepted that one of the most effective ways to improve one&amp;rsquo;s skill is to continually play against opponents which are slightly higher rated than you are. In mathematics, the opponents are unsolved or imperfectly understood mathematical problems, concepts, and theories, rather than other mathematicians; but the principle is broadly the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
