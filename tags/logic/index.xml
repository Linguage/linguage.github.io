      <title>How to Disagree</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/disagree/&#34;&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-disagree&#34;&gt;How to Disagree&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 2008&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The web is turning writing into a conversation. Twenty years ago, writers wrote and readers read. The web lets readers respond, and increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their own blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many who respond to something disagree with it. That&amp;rsquo;s to be expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there&amp;rsquo;s less to say. You could expand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications. When you disagree you&amp;rsquo;re entering territory he may not have explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Do Philosophy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/philosophy/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-do-philosophy&#34;&gt;How to Do Philosophy&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;September 2007&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college. I had several motives, some more honorable than others. One of the less honorable was to shock people. College was regarded as job training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do. Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
