That idea is not exactly novel. We&amp;rsquo;ve got it down to four words: &amp;ldquo;Do what you love.&amp;rdquo; But it&amp;rsquo;s not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn&amp;rsquo;t — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
