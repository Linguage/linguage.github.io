      <title>Bradley&#39;s Ghost</title>

Here I want to examine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Ohio, which Kerry ultimately lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory. And this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just random error. In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote. In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted a dead heat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Distraction</title>

It would work for a while, and then I&amp;rsquo;d gradually find myself using the Internet on my work computer. I&amp;rsquo;m trying other strategies now, but I think this time I&amp;rsquo;ll wait till I&amp;rsquo;m sure they work before writing about them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Procrastination feeds on distractions. Most people find it uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These people are sometimes called &amp;ldquo;fanboys,&amp;rdquo; and though I dislike that term, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to use it here. We need some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from someone simply liking your work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Investor Herd Dynamics</title>

Which is of course a recipe for exponential growth. When one investor wants to invest in you, that makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating these forces is the essence of fundraising. They hear stories about stampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it&amp;rsquo;s therefore the mark of a successful startup to have this happen. But actually the two are not that highly correlated. Lots of startups that cause stampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a result of the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were only moderately popular with investors the first time they raised money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is It Worth Being Wise?</title>
      <link>https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_en/wisdom/</link>

Anyone can see they&amp;rsquo;re not the same by the number of people who are smart, but not very wise. And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem related. How?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is wisdom? I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s knowing what to do in a lot of situations. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word. A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keep Your Identity Small</title>

Why? Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s different about religion is that people don&amp;rsquo;t feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that. But on religion everyone&amp;rsquo;s an expert.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lies We Tell Kids</title>

I&amp;rsquo;m not saying we should stop, but I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may also be a benefit to us. We were all lied to as kids, and some of the lies we were told still affect us. So by studying the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of lies we were told.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of Determination</title>

We probably spend more time thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest. Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is determination. At first we thought it might be intelligence. Everyone likes to believe that&amp;rsquo;s what makes startups succeed. It makes a better story that a company won because its founders were so smart. The PR people and reporters who spread such stories probably believe them themselves. But while it certainly helps to be smart, it&amp;rsquo;s not the deciding factor. There are plenty of people as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of trolls. It&amp;rsquo;s an old one, as old as forums, but we&amp;rsquo;re still just learning what the causes are and how to address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Two Kinds of Judgement</title>
      <link>https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_en/judgement/</link>

Sometimes judging you correctly is the end goal. But there&amp;rsquo;s a second much more common type of judgement where it isn&amp;rsquo;t. We tend to regard all judgements of us as the first type. We&amp;rsquo;d probably be happier if we realized which are and which aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions. Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is to judge you correctly, there&amp;rsquo;s usually some kind of appeals process. If you feel you&amp;rsquo;ve been misjudged, you can protest that you&amp;rsquo;ve been treated unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What You (Want to)* Want</title>

At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you&amp;rsquo;re free to choose what you do?

      <title>Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas</title>

Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2005&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This summer, as an experiment, some friends and I are giving seed funding to a bunch of new startups. It&amp;rsquo;s an experiment because we&amp;rsquo;re prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re doing it during the summer—so even college students can participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful startups. And we know from experience that some undergrads are as capable as most grad students. The accepted age for startup founders has been creeping downward. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to find the lower bound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
