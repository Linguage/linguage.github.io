      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/want/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-you-want-to-want&#34;&gt;What You (Want to)* Want&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;November 2022&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I was about 9 I&amp;rsquo;ve been puzzled by the apparent contradiction between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you&amp;rsquo;re free to choose what you do?
