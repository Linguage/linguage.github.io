      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/randomness/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;see-randomness&#34;&gt;See Randomness&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2006, rev August 2009&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plato quotes Socrates as saying &amp;ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living.&amp;rdquo; Part of what he meant was that the proper role of humans is to think, just as the proper role of anteaters is to poke their noses into anthills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of ancient philosophy had the quality — and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this in an insulting way — of the kind of conversations freshmen have late at night in common rooms: What is our purpose? Well, we humans are as conspicuously different from other animals as the anteater. In our case the distinguishing feature is the ability to reason. So obviously that is what we should be doing, and a human who doesn&amp;rsquo;t is doing a bad job of being human — is no better than an animal. Now we&amp;rsquo;d give a different answer. At least, someone Socrates&amp;rsquo;s age would. We&amp;rsquo;d ask why we even suppose we have a &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo; in life. We may be better adapted for some things than others; we may be happier doing things we&amp;rsquo;re adapted for; but why assume purpose?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hundred-Year Language</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/hundred/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-hundred-year-language&#34;&gt;The Hundred-Year Language&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2003&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at PyCon 2003.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict what life will be like in a hundred years. There are only a few things we can say with certainty. We know that everyone will drive flying cars, that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildings hundreds of stories tall, that it will be dark most of the time, and that women will all be trained in the martial arts. Here I want to zoom in on one detail of this picture. What kind of programming language will they use to write the software controlling those flying cars?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
