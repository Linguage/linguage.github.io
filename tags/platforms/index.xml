      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1355/paul_graham/essays_zh/hackernews/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-ive-learned-from-hacker-news&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve Learned from Hacker News&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;February 2009&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hacker News was two years old last week. Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news. It&amp;rsquo;s grown bigger and taken up more time than I expected, but I don&amp;rsquo;t regret that because I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much from working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth&#34;&gt;Growth&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600 daily uniques. It&amp;rsquo;s since grown to around 22,000. This growth rate is a bit higher than I&amp;rsquo;d like. I&amp;rsquo;d like the site to grow, since a site that isn&amp;rsquo;t growing at least slowly is probably dead. But I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit—mainly because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
