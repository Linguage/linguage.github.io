      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/writing-guide/zh/give-appropriate-amounts-of-detail.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/give-appropriate-amounts-of-detail/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;give-appropriate-amounts-of-detail&#34;&gt;Give appropriate amounts of detail&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In presenting a mathematical argument the great thing is to give the educated reader the chance to catch on at once to the momentary point and take details for granted: his successive mouthfuls should be such as can be swallowed at sight; in case of accidents, or in case he wishes for once to check in detail, he should have only a clearly circumscribed little problem to solve (e.g. to check an identity: two trivialities omitted can add up to an impasse). The unpractised writer, even after the dawn of a conscience, gives him no such chance; before he can spot the point he has to tease his way through a maze of symbols of which not the tiniest suffix can be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/career-advice/zh/be-considerate-of-your-audience.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-considerate-of-your-audience/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;be-considerate-of-your-audience&#34;&gt;Be considerate of your audience&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think like a wise man, but communicate in the language of the people.&#xA;— William Butler Yeats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This advice applies primarily to papers, but also to lectures and seminars (though one should also bear in mind that talks are not the same as papers).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, one of the most important things in mathematics (though certainly not the only thing) is to get results, and prove them correctly. However, one also needs to make a good faith effort to communicate these results to their intended audience. (It may feel like you have attained some level of intellectual achievement if you can discuss a topic which is so difficult or jargon-heavy that most of your audience do not understand what you are talking about, but it is in fact a far greater intellectual achievement if you can actually communicate that difficult topic effectively to such an audience.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
