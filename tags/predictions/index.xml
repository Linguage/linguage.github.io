      <description>&lt;p&gt;â†’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/cred/&#34;&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;coronavirus-and-credibility&#34;&gt;Coronavirus and Credibility&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2020&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a video of TV journalists and politicians confidently saying that the coronavirus would be no worse than the flu. What struck me about it was not just how mistaken they seemed, but how daring. How could they feel safe saying such things?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer, I realized, is that they didn&amp;rsquo;t think they could get caught. They didn&amp;rsquo;t realize there was any danger in making false predictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and get away with it, because the things they make predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way out of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember what they said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
