      <title>Being Popular</title>

So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language. The expert told him that it would be a waste of time, that programming languages don&amp;rsquo;t become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how good his language was, no one would use it. At least, that was what had happened to the language he had designed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>If Lisp is So Great</title>

I was asked this question by a student in the audience at a talk I gave recently. Not for the first time, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In languages, as in so many things, there&amp;rsquo;s not much correlation between popularity and quality. Why does John Grisham (King of Torts sales rank, 44) outsell Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice sales rank, 6191)? Would even Grisham claim that it&amp;rsquo;s because he&amp;rsquo;s a better writer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Nerds are Unpopular</title>

This was easy to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the kids with mild cases of Down&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome, what in the language of the time we called &amp;ldquo;retards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
