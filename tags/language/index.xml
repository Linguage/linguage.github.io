      <title>How to Do Philosophy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/philosophy/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-do-philosophy&#34;&gt;How to Do Philosophy&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;September 2007&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college. I had several motives, some more honorable than others. One of the less honorable was to shock people. College was regarded as job training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do. Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Putting Ideas into Words</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/words/&#34;&gt;中文版&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;putting-ideas-into-words&#34;&gt;Putting Ideas into Words&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;February 2022&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn&amp;rsquo;t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won&amp;rsquo;t just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s why I write them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
