This is doubly true if one has not yet &lt;strong&gt;learnt the limitations of one&amp;rsquo;s tools&lt;/strong&gt; or acquired a healthy &lt;strong&gt;scepticism of one&amp;rsquo;s own work&lt;/strong&gt;, as this can lead to the humiliating spectacle of proudly announcing a major breakthrough on a well known problem, only to withdraw the preprint shortly afterwards after serious flaws (often arising from pushing a method well beyond its known limits, and encounting obstructions beyond those limits that were known to the experts) are pointed out in the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Be sceptical of your own work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/zh/be-sceptical-of-your-own-work.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-sceptical-of-your-own-work/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;be-sceptical-of-your-own-work&#34;&gt;Be sceptical of your own work&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes, which can be made, in a very narrow field.&#xA;— Niels Bohr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you unexpectedly find a problem solving itself almost effortlessly, and you can&amp;rsquo;t quite see why, you should try to analyse your solution more sceptically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the method may also be able to prove much stronger statements which are known to be false, which would imply that there is a flaw in the method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/early/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;early&#34;&gt;Early&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;October 2020&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don&amp;rsquo;t seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don&amp;rsquo;t. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t even reach the stage of making something they&amp;rsquo;re embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They&amp;rsquo;re too frightened even to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
