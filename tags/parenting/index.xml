      <title>Having Kids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/kids/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;having-kids&#34;&gt;Having Kids&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I&amp;rsquo;d have been sad to think I&amp;rsquo;d never have children. But did I want them now? No.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had kids, I&amp;rsquo;d become a parent, and parents, as I&amp;rsquo;d known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;d noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lies We Tell Kids</title>

I&amp;rsquo;m not saying we should stop, but I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may also be a benefit to us. We were all lied to as kids, and some of the lies we were told still affect us. So by studying the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of lies we were told.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Life is Short</title>

When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since there didn&amp;rsquo;t seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
