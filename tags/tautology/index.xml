&lt;p&gt;[Reprinted from a Google Buzz article from Sep 5, 2010.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early twentieth century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously argued that every mathematical theorem was a tautology, and thus all such theorems contained a trivial amount of content. There is a grain of truth to this; when a difficult mathematical problem is finally solved, it is often the case that the solution does make the original problem look significantly easier than had previously thought to be the case. Indeed, one could take the counter-intuitive point of view that progress in mathematics can be measured by how much of the subject has been made trivial (or at least easier to understand than previously).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
