&lt;p&gt;(a) Getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I worked with a team of students who claimed to have little experience with writing and were quite perplexed about how to write a research paper. But they were good at coding. So I asked them if they were comfortable writing in C++ and they said &amp;ldquo;of course&amp;rdquo;. So I told them we were going to write something new, but instead of writing in C++ we were going to write in &amp;ldquo;English&amp;rdquo;. How is this helpful? Many STEM students claim to be uncomfortable writers but they understand how to learn good style and formatting for programming by reading other people&amp;rsquo;s work and using structure from others work. This same idea can be very helpful for the novice paper-writer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
