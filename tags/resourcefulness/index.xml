      <title>A Word to the Resourceful</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/word/&#34;&gt;中文版&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-word-to-the-resourceful&#34;&gt;A Word to the Resourceful&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;January 2012&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups we&amp;rsquo;d funded: they all seemed hard to talk to. It felt as if there was some kind of wall between us. I could never quite tell if they understood what I was saying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This caught my attention because earlier we&amp;rsquo;d noticed a pattern among the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a different quality. We found the startups that did best were the ones with the sort of founders about whom we&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;ldquo;they can take care of themselves.&amp;rdquo; The startups that do best are fire-and-forget in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they&amp;rsquo;ll close it, whatever type of lead it is. When they&amp;rsquo;re raising money, for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you wanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point. You won&amp;rsquo;t have to babysit the round to make sure it happens. That type of founder is going to come back with the money; the only question is how much on what terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relentlessly Resourceful</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/relres/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;relentlessly-resourceful&#34;&gt;Relentlessly Resourceful&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 2009&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Till then the best I&amp;rsquo;d managed was to get the opposite quality down to one: hapless. Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky. But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A team that outplays its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be called unlucky, but not hapless. Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world. [1]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
