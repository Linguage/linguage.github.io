      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/smart/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;beyond-smart&#34;&gt;Beyond Smart&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;October 2021&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first. Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t what was special about Einstein. What was special about him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
