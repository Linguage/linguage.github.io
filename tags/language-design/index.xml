      <title>Being Popular</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/popular/&#34;&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;being-popular&#34;&gt;Being Popular&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May 2001&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This article was written as a kind of business plan for a new language. So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language. The expert told him that it would be a waste of time, that programming languages don&amp;rsquo;t become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how good his language was, no one would use it. At least, that was what had happened to the language he had designed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hundred-Year Language</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/hundred/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-hundred-year-language&#34;&gt;The Hundred-Year Language&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2003&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at PyCon 2003.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict what life will be like in a hundred years. There are only a few things we can say with certainty. We know that everyone will drive flying cars, that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildings hundreds of stories tall, that it will be dark most of the time, and that women will all be trained in the martial arts. Here I want to zoom in on one detail of this picture. What kind of programming language will they use to write the software controlling those flying cars?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
