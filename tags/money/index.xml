      <title>How to Do What You Love</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/love/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-do-what-you-love&#34;&gt;How to Do What You Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;January 2006&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We&amp;rsquo;ve got it down to four words: &amp;ldquo;Do what you love.&amp;rdquo; But it&amp;rsquo;s not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn&amp;rsquo;t — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I now had to think about something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I&amp;rsquo;d spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Raise Money</title>

Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;September 2013&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most startups that raise money do it more than once. A typical trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then (2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When To Do What You Love</title>

Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but the border between should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t is very complicated. The only way to give a general answer is to trace it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people talk about this question, there&amp;rsquo;s always an implicit &amp;ldquo;instead of.&amp;rdquo; All other things being equal, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you work on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies that all other things aren&amp;rsquo;t equal, and that you have to choose between working on what interests you the most and something else, like what pays the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
