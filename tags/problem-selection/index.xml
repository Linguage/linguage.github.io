&lt;p&gt;Little has been written on managing your own research (and very little on avoiding other people managing your research); however, your research is much more under your control than you may realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned with great research here. Work that will get wide recognition, perhaps even win Nobel Prize. As most people realize, the average published paper is read by the author, the referee, and perhaps one other person. Classic papers are read by thousands. We are concerned with research that will matter in the long run and become more than a footnote in history.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
