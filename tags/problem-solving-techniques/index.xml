This can be a rather different mindset than what one commonly sees in more &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; situations such as business, sports, engineering, or politics, where actual success or failure often matters much more than what one can salvage from a partial success. I think the basic reason for this is that in the purely theoretical world of mathematics, there is basically a zero cost in taking an argument that partially solves a problem, and then combining it with other ideas to make a complete solution; but in the real world, it can be difficult, costly, or socially unacceptable to reuse or recycle anything that is (or is perceived to be) even a partial failure. Software engineering is one of the few exceptions to this general rule, as it is almost as easy to reuse software code as it is to reuse a mathematical argument.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
