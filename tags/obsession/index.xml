This is doubly true if one has not yet &lt;strong&gt;learnt the limitations of one&amp;rsquo;s tools&lt;/strong&gt; or acquired a healthy &lt;strong&gt;scepticism of one&amp;rsquo;s own work&lt;/strong&gt;, as this can lead to the humiliating spectacle of proudly announcing a major breakthrough on a well known problem, only to withdraw the preprint shortly afterwards after serious flaws (often arising from pushing a method well beyond its known limits, and encounting obstructions beyond those limits that were known to the experts) are pointed out in the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/genius/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-bus-ticket-theory-of-genius&#34;&gt;The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;November 2019&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and determination. But there&amp;rsquo;s a third ingredient that&amp;rsquo;s not as well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group of people, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to choose bus ticket collectors. There are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect. They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember. Because we don&amp;rsquo;t care enough. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of spending so much time thinking about old bus tickets?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
