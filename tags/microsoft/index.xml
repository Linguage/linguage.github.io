      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1366/paul_graham/essays_zh/microsoft/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;microsoft-is-dead&#34;&gt;Microsoft is Dead&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 2007&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead. I was talking to a young startup founder about how Google was different from Yahoo. I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by their fear of Microsoft. That was why they&amp;rsquo;d positioned themselves as a &amp;ldquo;media company&amp;rdquo; instead of a technology company. Then I looked at his face and realized he didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. It was as if I&amp;rsquo;d told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid 80s. Barry who? Microsoft? He didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, but I could tell he didn&amp;rsquo;t quite believe anyone would be frightened of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not just small, lame. Not just the first step up a big mountain. More like the first step into a swamp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
