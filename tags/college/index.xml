Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;October 2014&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman&amp;rsquo;s startup class at Stanford. It&amp;rsquo;s intended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask yourself &amp;ldquo;what would I tell my own kids?&amp;rdquo; My kids are little, but I can imagine what I&amp;rsquo;d tell them about startups if they were in college, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>News from the Front</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/colleges/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;news-from-the-front&#34;&gt;News from the Front&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;September 2007&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up. What was I? A student. To do that well meant to get good grades. Why did one have to get good grades? To get into a good college. And why did one want to do that? There seemed to be several reasons: you&amp;rsquo;d learn more, get better jobs, make more money. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter exactly what the benefits would be. College was a bottleneck through which all your future prospects passed; everything would be better if you went to a better college.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Get funded by Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 2005&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to me with questions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had several emails from computer science undergrads asking what to do in college. I might not be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in college. But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought I was one. I was certainly a hacker, at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
