      <title>A Project of One&#39;s Own</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-project-of-ones-own&#34;&gt;A Project of One&amp;rsquo;s Own&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;June 2021&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son told me he couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get home to write more of the story he was working on. This made me as happy as anything I&amp;rsquo;ve heard him say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because he&amp;rsquo;d discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking. It&amp;rsquo;s more fun, but also much more productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Do What You Love</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/paul_graham/essays_zh/love/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-do-what-you-love&#34;&gt;How to Do What You Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;January 2006&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We&amp;rsquo;ve got it down to four words: &amp;ldquo;Do what you love.&amp;rdquo; But it&amp;rsquo;s not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn&amp;rsquo;t — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Doesn&#39;t Seem Like Work?</title>

For most of my childhood he worked for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to do. When you talk to him about his childhood, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear watershed at about age 12, when he &amp;ldquo;got interested in maths.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of Pwllheli. As we retraced his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been nice growing up in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When To Do What You Love</title>

Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but the border between should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t is very complicated. The only way to give a general answer is to trace it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people talk about this question, there&amp;rsquo;s always an implicit &amp;ldquo;instead of.&amp;rdquo; All other things being equal, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you work on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies that all other things aren&amp;rsquo;t equal, and that you have to choose between working on what interests you the most and something else, like what pays the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
