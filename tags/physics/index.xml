      <description>&lt;p&gt;â†’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1326/paul_graham/essays_zh/disc/&#34;&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-risk-of-discovery&#34;&gt;The Risk of Discovery&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;January 2017&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because biographies of famous scientists tend to edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the degree of risk they were willing to take. And because anything a famous scientist did that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a mistake has probably now become the conventional wisdom, those choices don&amp;rsquo;t seem risky either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus more on physics than alchemy or theology. The impression we get is that his unerring judgment led him straight to truths no one else had noticed. How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy and theology? Well, smart people are often kind of crazy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
