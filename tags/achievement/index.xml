      <description>&lt;p&gt;â†’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1355/paul_graham/essays_zh/determination/&#34;&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-anatomy-of-determination&#34;&gt;The Anatomy of Determination&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;September 2009&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to predict which startups will succeed. We probably spend more time thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest. Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is determination. At first we thought it might be intelligence. Everyone likes to believe that&amp;rsquo;s what makes startups succeed. It makes a better story that a company won because its founders were so smart. The PR people and reporters who spread such stories probably believe them themselves. But while it certainly helps to be smart, it&amp;rsquo;s not the deciding factor. There are plenty of people as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
