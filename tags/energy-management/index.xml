      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/career-advice/zh/on-time-management.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;link-card&#34; data-url=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;link-card__fallback&#34; href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;    https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-time-management&#34;&gt;On time management&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prodded by several comments, I have finally decided to write up some my thoughts on time management here. I actually have been drafting something about this subject for a while, but I soon realised that my own experience with time management is still very much a work in progress (you should see my backlog of papers that need writing up) and I don’t yet have a coherent or definitive philosophy on this topic (other than my &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/writing-guide/on-writing/&#34;&gt;advice on writing papers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance my &lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/write-a-rapid-prototype-first/&#34;&gt;page on rapid prototyping&lt;/a&gt;). Also, I can only talk about my own personal experiences, which probably do not generalise to all personality types or work situations, though perhaps readers may wish to contribute their own thoughts, experiences, or suggestions in the comments here. [I should also add that I don’t always follow my own advice on these matters, often to my own regret.]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
