<p>A Unified Theory of VC Suckage March 2005A couple months ago I got an email from a recruiter asking if I was interested in being a &ldquo;technologist in residence&rdquo; at a new venture capital fund. I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs&rsquo; George Bush.I considered it for about four seconds. Work for a VC fund? Ick.One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visit Greylock, the famous Boston VCs. They were the most arrogant people I&rsquo;ve met in my life. And I&rsquo;ve met a lot of arrogant people. [1]I&rsquo;m not alone in feeling this way, of course. Even a VC friend of mine dislikes VCs. &ldquo;Assholes,&rdquo; he says.But lately I&rsquo;ve been learning more about how the VC world works, and a few days ago it hit me that there&rsquo;s a reason VCs are the way they are. It&rsquo;s not so much that the business attracts jerks, or even that the power they wield corrupts them. The real problem is the way they&rsquo;re paid.The problem with VC funds is that they&rsquo;re funds. Like the managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees, plus a percentage of the gains. So they want the fund to be huge&ndash; hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible. But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing a lot of money. And since one person can only manage so many deals, each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs that founders hate.It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds, and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2] With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.It explains why they steal your ideas. Every founder knows that VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up investing in them. It&rsquo;s not unheard of for VCs to meet you when they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for a competitor. This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive. Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business. Either way it sucks. But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the giant deals they do. With so much at stake, they have to be devious.It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest in. They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise you, but so that they can watch you. Often they even install a new CEO. Yes, he may have extensive business experience. But he&rsquo;s also their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit. With so much at stake, VCs can&rsquo;t resist micromanaging you.The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike, if they realized how damaging they can be. VCs don&rsquo;t invest $x million because that&rsquo;s the amount you need, but because that&rsquo;s the amount the structure of their business requires them to invest. Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good. Google survived enormous VC funding because it could legitimately absorb large amounts of money. They had to buy a lot of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web. Less fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around having meetings.In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury bills, and continue to operate frugally. You just try it.And of course giant investments mean giant valuations. They have to, or there&rsquo;s not enough stock left to keep the founders interested. You might think a high valuation is a great thing. Many founders do. But you can&rsquo;t eat paper. You can&rsquo;t benefit from a high valuation unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business call a &ldquo;liquidity event,&rdquo; and the higher your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that. Many a founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs who&rsquo;ve just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won&rsquo;t hear of that. You&rsquo;re rolling the dice again, whether you like it or not.Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single round of VC funding. This was at the time more than the valuation of our entire company. Was I worried? Not at all: I was delighted. It was like watching a car you&rsquo;re chasing turn down a street that you know has no outlet.Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us. We would have sold. Their investors would have been furious of course. But I think the main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined we could be had so cheap. They probably assumed we were on the same VC gravy train they were.In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence. And that gave us flexibility. We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for $50 million, and everyone was delighted. If our competitor had done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost money. I assume they could have vetoed such a deal. But no one those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo. So unless their founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn&rsquo;t do it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment bankers. Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs who&rsquo;d invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way out. The only people dumber were retail investors. So it was literally IPO or bust. Or rather, IPO then bust, or just bust.Add up all the evidence of VCs&rsquo; behavior, and the resulting personality is not attractive. In fact, it&rsquo;s the classic villain: alternately cowardly, greedy, sneaky, and overbearing.I used to take it for granted that VCs were like this. Complaining that VCs were jerks used to seem as naive to me as complaining that users didn&rsquo;t read the reference manual. Of course VCs were jerks. How could it be otherwise?But I realize now that they&rsquo;re not intrinsically jerks. VCs are like car salesmen or bureaucrats: the nature of their work turns them into jerks.I&rsquo;ve met a few VCs I like. Mike Moritz seems a good guy. He even has a sense of humor, which is almost unheard of among VCs. From what I&rsquo;ve read about John Doerr, he sounds like a good guy too, almost a hacker. But they work for the very best VC funds. And my theory explains why they&rsquo;d tend to be different: just as the very most popular kids don&rsquo;t have to persecute nerds, the very best VCs don&rsquo;t have to act like VCs. They get the pick of all the best deals. So they don&rsquo;t have to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they can choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actually benefit from the giant sums they&rsquo;re compelled to invest.VCs often complain that in their business there&rsquo;s too much money chasing too few deals. Few realize that this also describes a flaw in the way funding works at the level of individual firms.Perhaps this was the sort of strategic insight I was supposed to come up with as a &ldquo;technologist in residence.&rdquo; If so, the good news is that they&rsquo;re getting it for free. The bad news is it means that if you&rsquo;re not one of the very top funds, you&rsquo;re condemned to be the bad guys.Notes[1] After Greylock booted founder Philip Greenspun out of ArsDigita, he wrote a hilarious but also very informative essay about it. [2] Since most VCs aren&rsquo;t tech guys, the technology side of their due diligence tends to be like a body cavity search by someone with a faulty knowledge of human anatomy. After a while we were quite sore from VCs attempting to probe our nonexistent database orifice.No, we don&rsquo;t use Oracle. We just store the data in files. Our secret is to use an OS that doesn&rsquo;t lose our data. Which OS? FreeBSD. Why do you use that instead of Windows NT? Because it&rsquo;s better and it doesn&rsquo;t cost anything. What, you&rsquo;re using a freeware OS?How many times that conversation was repeated. Then when we got to Yahoo, we found they used FreeBSD and stored their data in files too.Chinese TranslationJapanese Translation</p>

<p>Snapshot: Viaweb, June 1998 January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998 I took a snapshot of Viaweb&rsquo;s site. I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are. Screens were a lot smaller in 1998. If I remember correctly, our frontpage used to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts and they weren&rsquo;t antialiased. If you wanted to make pages that looked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos. We did that as an inside joke when we started YC. Considering how basic a red circle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how few other companies used one as their logo. A bit later I realized why.On the Company page you&rsquo;ll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem. Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the Worm that he didn&rsquo;t want his name on the site. I managed to get him to agree to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name. He has since relaxed a bit on that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire PhD. The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases was one celebrating his graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during a meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino Bagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire to build stores for them. We inserted him as a ringer in case some competitor tried to spam our web designers. We assumed his logo would deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines and newspapers. There were not the same ways to get found online that there are today. So we used to pay a PR firm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press. Fortunately reporters liked us.In our advice about getting traffic from search engines (I don&rsquo;t think the term SEO had been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot. Notice anything missing? Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called Cybercash, since if we lacked that feature we&rsquo;d have gotten beaten up in product comparisons. But Cybercash was so bad and most stores&rsquo; order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders. We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants out of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the test drive. It was a novel thing to be able to try out software online. We put cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our software worked.We had some well known users. Needless to say, Frederick&rsquo;s of Hollywood got the most traffic. We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores, so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic. I once calculated how much Frederick&rsquo;s was costing us in bandwidth, and it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth. We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec) coming into our offices. In those days there was no AWS. Even colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things went wrong with them. So we had our servers in our offices. Or more precisely, in Trevor&rsquo;s office. In return for the unique privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to share it with 6 shrieking tower servers. His office was nicknamed the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated. Most days his stack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after Rtm. RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries, and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it had syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn&rsquo;t actually have versions. But in those days the trade press expected versions, so we made them up. If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made the version number an integer. That &ldquo;version 4.0&rdquo; icon was generated by our own button generator, incidentally. The whole Viaweb site was made with our software, even though it wasn&rsquo;t an online store, because we wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search engine called Shopfind. It was pretty advanced for the time. It had a programmable crawler that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out the products.</p>

<p>What You (Want to)* Want November 2022Since I was about 9 I&rsquo;ve been puzzled by the apparent contradiction between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn&rsquo;t responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you&rsquo;re free to choose what you do? [1]The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can&rsquo;t want what you want. Yes, you can control what you do, but you&rsquo;ll do what you want, and you can&rsquo;t control that.The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they want. People who don&rsquo;t want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can&rsquo;t want to want what you want.That&rsquo;s still not quite true. It&rsquo;s possible to change what you want to want. I can imagine someone saying &ldquo;I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.&rdquo; But we&rsquo;re getting closer to the truth. It&rsquo;s rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more &ldquo;want to&quot;s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more &ldquo;want to&quot;s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice three or four &ldquo;want to&quot;s must surely be enough. It&rsquo;s hard even to envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want to want, let alone actually do it.So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular expression. You can do what you want, but there&rsquo;s some statement of the form &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t (want to)* want what you want&rdquo; that&rsquo;s true. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don&rsquo;t control. [2] Notes[1] I didn&rsquo;t know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly, but I don&rsquo;t think it affects the problem much. Randomness destroys the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.[2] If you don&rsquo;t like using an expression, you can make the same point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you don&rsquo;t control your nth-order desires. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.Irish Translation</p>

<p>How to Make Wealth Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. May 2004 (This essay was originally published in Hackers &amp; Painters.) If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That&rsquo;s been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word &ldquo;startup&rdquo; dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase &ldquo;high-tech startup&rdquo; is almost redundant. A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don&rsquo;t have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger? And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?The PropositionEconomically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition. If you&rsquo;re a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average such a hacker must be able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even. You could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour. [1] You should get another multiple of two, at least, by eliminating the drag of the pointy-haired middle manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I&rsquo;m claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you&rsquo;re expected to be in a random corporate job. [2] If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn&rsquo;t try to defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the structure of the calculation. I&rsquo;m not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we&rsquo;re talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.Startups are not magic. They don&rsquo;t change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars&rsquo; worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can&rsquo;t evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.Millions, not BillionsIf $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others. Three million? How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?So let&rsquo;s get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM&rsquo;s side, Microsoft&rsquo;s future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.If IBM hadn&rsquo;t made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he&rsquo;d be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it&rsquo;s more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it&rsquo;s more straightforward. You just have to do something people want.Money Is Not WealthIf you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. [3] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn&rsquo;t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter how much money you had.Wealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand how to make money.Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can&rsquo;t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return. But you can&rsquo;t get very far by trading things directly with the people who need them. If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The intermediate stuff&ndash; the medium of exchange&ndash; can be anything that&rsquo;s rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we&rsquo;ve been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn&rsquo;t physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means. People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage&ndash; just a shorthand&ndash; for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want. [4]The Pie FallacyA surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But that&rsquo;s not the same thing.When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make the pie larger,&rdquo; say politicians. When you&rsquo;re talking about the amount of money in one family&rsquo;s bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year&rsquo;s tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you&rsquo;re planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It&rsquo;s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is&ndash; and you specifically are&ndash; one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you&rsquo;ll get more for it.In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven&rsquo;t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. [5]Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don&rsquo;t have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones&ndash; a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts. And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.CraftsmenThe people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers.A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth. A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those characters you type are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn&rsquo;t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer. [5b]Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel department) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They literally think the product, one line at a time. And so it&rsquo;s clearer to programmers that wealth is something that&rsquo;s made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary Daddy.It&rsquo;s also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).This is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth&ndash; undergraduates, reporters, politicians&ndash; hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to think injustice! An experienced programmer would be more likely to think is that all? The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we&rsquo;re less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I&rsquo;m running on the computer I&rsquo;m using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.What a Job IsIn industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, institution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution. Superficially it&rsquo;s a lot like college. You pick the companies you want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you become a member of this new group. You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But the similarities feel greater than the differences. John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.In fact John Smith&rsquo;s life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is location. Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and cook you dinner and so on? It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location in central Asia. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth. Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don&rsquo;t make anything physical. Nearly all companies exist to do something people want.And that&rsquo;s what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people&rsquo;s. You may not even be aware you&rsquo;re doing something people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won&rsquo;t make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don&rsquo;t need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It&rsquo;s doing something people want that matters, not joining the group. [6]For most people the best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company. But it is a good idea to understand what&rsquo;s happening when you do this. A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.Working HarderThat averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person&rsquo;s work. For the most part they punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You&rsquo;re expected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you&rsquo;re not expected to devote your whole life to your work.It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can&rsquo;t go to your boss and say, I&rsquo;d like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.Salesmen are an exception. It&rsquo;s easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they&rsquo;re usually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, and he will automatically get paid proportionally more.There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured. The top managers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary employee&rsquo;s performance can&rsquo;t usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort. Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the company does badly, he&rsquo;s done badly.A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.Unfortunately, companies can&rsquo;t pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees&rsquo; work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;ve got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget&rsquo;s sales are due to each group&rsquo;s efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality? There&rsquo;s no way to untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you&rsquo;d find these factors were all blurred together.If you want to go faster, it&rsquo;s a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people&rsquo;s. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable&ndash; and the rest of the group slows you down.Measurement and LeverageTo get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They&rsquo;re measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another.I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they&rsquo;re out. If you&rsquo;re in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.But you don&rsquo;t have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.Smallness = MeasurementIf you can&rsquo;t measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one&rsquo;s boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much. There are two differences: you&rsquo;re not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and you&rsquo;re not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other ambitious people.It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can&rsquo;t be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, because it&rsquo;s their work that yours is going to be averaged with.A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don&rsquo;t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It&rsquo;s a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.That&rsquo;s the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees. I agree. If anything, it&rsquo;s more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select. You don&rsquo;t want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average for the population as a whole. So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others. Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large company. But a very able person who does care about money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.Technology = LeverageStartups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they&rsquo;re small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.What is technology? It&rsquo;s technique. It&rsquo;s the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish. That&rsquo;s the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That&rsquo;s leverage.If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology. You just can&rsquo;t fry eggs or cut hair fast enough. What made the Florentines rich in 1200 was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth. What made the Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas of the Far East.Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that&rsquo;s valuable today could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don&rsquo;t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.Big companies can develop technology. They just can&rsquo;t do it quickly. Their size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components and ideas.It&rsquo;s obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don&rsquo;t seem to be about technology. McDonald&rsquo;s, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald&rsquo;s franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald&rsquo;s franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we&rsquo;d always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but because it was harder. We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can&rsquo;t follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical problem. And I&rsquo;d be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.This is not just a good way to run a startup. It&rsquo;s what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry. If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he&rsquo;ll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to develop? That is, how much difficult ground have you put between yourself and potential pursuers? [7] And you had better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to duplicate. Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they&rsquo;ll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they&rsquo;ll take away your market overnight. You&rsquo;d be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much protection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can&rsquo;t, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it&rsquo;s an everyday thing for them. They&rsquo;ll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time. Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth? He invented television. The reason you&rsquo;ve never heard of him is that his company was not the one to make money from it. [8] The company that did was RCA, and Farnsworth&rsquo;s reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that&rsquo;s simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don&rsquo;t need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. [9]The Catch(es)If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup. Up to a point it would be more fun. I don&rsquo;t think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can&rsquo;t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can&rsquo;t decide, for example, that you&rsquo;d like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more. When you&rsquo;re running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can.The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the deal is not that you&rsquo;re 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that you&rsquo;re 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about during the Internet Bubble. It&rsquo;s common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you don&rsquo;t generally know which of the two you&rsquo;re going to get till the last minute. Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave. Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but it was damned close. While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb&rsquo;s hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company. But there were no takers, so we had to keep going.It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.Get UsersI think it&rsquo;s a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It&rsquo;s also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client&rsquo;s assets into one volatile stock?How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you&rsquo;d do if you didn&rsquo;t intend to sell the company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don&rsquo;t buy you now, you&rsquo;ll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.In both cases, what it all comes down to is users. You&rsquo;d think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you&rsquo;ve created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren&rsquo;t using your software, maybe it&rsquo;s not just because you&rsquo;re bad at marketing. Maybe it&rsquo;s because you haven&rsquo;t made what they want.Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you&rsquo;re not just trying to solve problems. You&rsquo;re trying to solve problems that users care about.So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close. It&rsquo;s what acquirers care about. It&rsquo;s what revenues depend on. It&rsquo;s what makes competitors unhappy. It&rsquo;s what impresses reporters, and potential new users. Certainly it&rsquo;s a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly&ndash; taking a long time to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you&rsquo;re optimizing based on guesses.The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy. How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind? When you hear &ldquo;your call is important to us, please stay on the line,&rdquo; do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that&rsquo;s what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.Wealth and PowerMaking wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world&rsquo;s history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. [10] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds&rsquo; lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. They&rsquo;re willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they&rsquo;re not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two. They are like the corporate boss that you can&rsquo;t go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It&rsquo;s that it tends not to happen at all. It&rsquo;s only when you&rsquo;re deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.Once you&rsquo;re allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn&rsquo;t have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don&rsquo;t let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.Notes[1] One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is uninterruptability. Different kinds of work have different time quanta. Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head. So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it&rsquo;s next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).One great advantage of startups is that they don&rsquo;t yet have any of the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.[2] Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people working for me to do that? The answer is simple: pay them to.Internally most companies are run like Communist states. If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.[3] Until recently even governments sometimes didn&rsquo;t grasp the distinction between money and wealth. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations, v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; by forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.[4] There are many senses of the word &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; not all of them material. I&rsquo;m not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is the true kind. I&rsquo;m writing about one specific, rather technical sense of the word &ldquo;wealth.&rdquo; What people will give you money for. This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for depends on them, not you.When you&rsquo;re starting a business, it&rsquo;s easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an &ldquo;outdoor portal.&rdquo; You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.What&rsquo;s the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. That is where your idea of what&rsquo;s valuable is least likely to coincide with other people&rsquo;s.[5] In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the environment. While environmental costs should be taken into account, they don&rsquo;t make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair a machine that&rsquo;s broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create wealth with no environmental cost.[5b] This essay was written before Firefox.[6] Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the surface similarities. You&rsquo;ve gone from guest to servant. It&rsquo;s possible to have fun in this new world. Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say &ldquo;authorized personnel only.&rdquo; But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you&rsquo;re not consciously aware of it.[7] When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.[8] Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know the &ldquo;inventor&rdquo; of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company made money from it, and the company&rsquo;s PR people worked hard to spread the story. If you don&rsquo;t know who invented something (the automobile, the television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it&rsquo;s because other companies made all the money.[9] This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you&rsquo;re trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you&rsquo;re even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what&rsquo;s the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.[10] It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.[11] It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn&rsquo;t the Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and not incompatible) answers: (a) It did. The Industrial Revolution was one in a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means of production.

<p>Web 2.0 Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. November 2005Does &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; mean anything? Till recently I thought it didn&rsquo;t, but the truth turns out to be more complicated. Originally, yes, it was meaningless. Now it seems to have acquired a meaning. And yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it means what I think it does, we don&rsquo;t need it.I first heard the phrase &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004. At the time it was supposed to mean using &ldquo;the web as a platform,&rdquo; which I took to refer to web-based applications. [1]So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O&rsquo;Reilly led a session intended to figure out a definition of &ldquo;Web 2.0.&rdquo; Didn&rsquo;t it already mean using the web as a platform? And if it didn&rsquo;t already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?OriginsTim says the phrase &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; first arose in &ldquo;a brainstorming session between O&rsquo;Reilly and Medialive International.&rdquo; What is Medialive International? &ldquo;Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,&rdquo; according to their site. So presumably that&rsquo;s what this brainstorming session was about. O&rsquo;Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web, and they were wondering what to call it.I don&rsquo;t think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a new version of the web. They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again. It was a kind of semantic deficit spending: they knew new things were coming, and the &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; referred to whatever those might turn out to be.And they were right. New things were coming. But the new version number led to some awkwardness in the short term. In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have decided they&rsquo;d better take a stab at explaining what that &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; referred to. Whatever it meant, &ldquo;the web as a platform&rdquo; was at least not too constricting.The story about &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; meaning the web as a platform didn&rsquo;t live much past the first conference. By the second conference, what &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; seemed to mean was something about democracy. At least, it did when people wrote about it online. The conference itself didn&rsquo;t seem very grassroots. It cost $2800, so the only people who could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel&rsquo;s article about the conference in Wired News spoke of &ldquo;throngs of geeks.&rdquo; When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news to him. He said he&rsquo;d originally written something like &ldquo;throngs of VCs and biz dev guys&rdquo; but had later shortened it just to &ldquo;throngs,&rdquo; and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into &ldquo;throngs of geeks.&rdquo; After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably be full of geeks, right?Well, no. There were about 7. Even Tim O&rsquo;Reilly was wearing a suit, a sight so alien I couldn&rsquo;t parse it at first. I saw him walk by and said to one of the O&rsquo;Reilly people &ldquo;that guy looks just like Tim.&ldquo;&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Tim. He bought a suit.&rdquo; I ran after him, and sure enough, it was. He explained that he&rsquo;d just bought it in Thailand.The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup. There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large number of people determined not to miss out. Miss out on what? They didn&rsquo;t know. Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be.I wouldn&rsquo;t quite call it &ldquo;Bubble 2.0&rdquo; just because VCs are eager to invest again. The Internet is a genuinely big deal. The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom. It&rsquo;s to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.The reason this won&rsquo;t turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone. Venture investors are driven by exit strategies. The reason they were funding all those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing all the way to the bank. Now that route is closed. Now the default exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to irrational exuberance than IPO investors. The closest you&rsquo;ll get to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for Myspace. That&rsquo;s only off by a factor of 10 or so.1. AjaxDoes &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; mean anything more than the name of a conference yet? I don&rsquo;t like to admit it, but it&rsquo;s starting to. When people say &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; now, I have some idea what they mean. And the fact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to mean something.One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes. Basically, what &ldquo;Ajax&rdquo; means is &ldquo;Javascript now works.&rdquo; And that in turn means that web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones.As you read this, a whole new generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax. There hasn&rsquo;t been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared. Even Microsoft sees it, but it&rsquo;s too late for them to do anything more than leak &ldquo;internal&rdquo; documents designed to give the impression they&rsquo;re on top of this new trend.In fact the new generation of software is being written way too fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own in house. Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups before Google does. And even that&rsquo;s going to be hard, because Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago. After all, Google Maps, the canonical Ajax application, was the result of a startup they bought.So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big component of Web 2.0. But I&rsquo;m convinced they got this right by accident. The Ajax boom didn&rsquo;t start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term &ldquo;Ajax&rdquo; was coined.2. DemocracyThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy. We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to channel their efforts. Wikipedia may be the most famous. Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but they miss the critical point: it&rsquo;s good enough. And it&rsquo;s free, which means people actually read it. On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if you were willing to pay to read them yourself, you can&rsquo;t link to them. They&rsquo;re not part of the conversation.Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as news. I never look at any news site now except Reddit. [2] I know if something major happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it will show up there. Why bother checking the front page of any specific paper or magazine? Reddit&rsquo;s like an RSS feed for the whole web, with a filter for quality. Similar sites include Digg, a technology news site that&rsquo;s rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the &ldquo;tagging&rdquo; movement. And whereas Wikipedia&rsquo;s main appeal is that it&rsquo;s good enough and free, these sites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human editors.The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection of ideas, but their production. I&rsquo;ve noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people&rsquo;s sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers and magazines. And now I have independent evidence: the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people&rsquo;s sites rather than to magazine articles or news stories.My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation. Editors. They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce. The result is to damp extremes. Editing yields 95th percentile writing—95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are dragged down. 5% of the time you get &ldquo;throngs of geeks.&ldquo;On the web, people can publish whatever they want. Nearly all of it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications. But the pool of writers is very, very large. If it&rsquo;s large enough, the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass the best in print. [3] And now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net. Selection beats damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.Even the startups are different this time around. They are to the startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media. During the Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was blowing through several million dollars of VC money to &ldquo;get big fast&rdquo; in the most literal sense. Now it means a smaller, younger, more technical group that just decided to make something great. They&rsquo;ll decide later if they want to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they&rsquo;ll take it on their terms.3. Don&rsquo;t Maltreat UsersI think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements of &ldquo;Web 2.0.&rdquo; I also see a third: not to maltreat users. During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users. And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting them to annoying ads. The very design of the average site in the late 90s was an abuse. Many of the most popular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the user the message: this is our site, not yours. (There&rsquo;s a physical analog in the Intel and Microsoft stickers that come on some laptops.)I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving something away for free, and till recently a company giving anything away for free could be pretty high-handed about it. Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them. The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com, where you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you have sit through a movie.At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord it over users. Never make users register, unless you need to in order to store something for them. If you do make users register, never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact, don&rsquo;t even ask for their email address unless you need it for some reason. Don&rsquo;t ask them any unnecessary questions. Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it. Never frame pages you link to, or open them in new windows. If you have a free version and a pay version, don&rsquo;t make the free version too restricted. And if you find yourself asking &ldquo;should we allow users to do x?&rdquo; just answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; whenever you&rsquo;re unsure. Err on the side of generosity.In How to Start a Startup I advised startups never to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other company offer a cheaper, easier solution. Another way to fly low is to give users more power. Let users do what they want. If you don&rsquo;t and a competitor does, you&rsquo;re in trouble.iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense. Finally you can buy individual songs instead of having to buy whole albums. The recording industry hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible. But it was obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels. [4] Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5. Web 2.0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands giving away DRMless songs for free.The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for free that competitors charge for. During the 90s a lot of people probably thought we&rsquo;d have some working system for micropayments by now. In fact things have gone in the other direction. The most successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff away for free. Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the previous generation of dating sites.Serving web pages is very, very cheap. If you can make even a fraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit. And technology for targeting ads continues to improve. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to make as little money as possible. If you can figure out a way to turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry, so much the better, if all fifty million go to you. Though indeed, making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the end, just as automating things often turns out to generate more jobs.The ultimate target is Microsoft. What a bang that balloon is going to make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative to MS Office. [5] Who will? Google? They seem to be taking their time. I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea. (How hard can it be?)The Common ThreadAjax, democracy, and not dissing users. What do they all have in common? I didn&rsquo;t realize they had anything in common till recently, which is one of the reasons I disliked the term &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; so much. It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened to be new—that it didn&rsquo;t predict anything.But there is a common thread. Web 2.0 means using the web the way it&rsquo;s meant to be used. The &ldquo;trends&rdquo; we&rsquo;re seeing now are simply the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models that got imposed on it during the Bubble.I realized this when I read an interview with Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite. [6] Excite really never got the business model right at all. We fell into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get figured out. It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years after the Bubble burst. But in retrospect, something was happening: the web was finding its natural angle of repose. The democracy component, for example—that&rsquo;s not an innovation, in the sense of something someone made happen. That&rsquo;s what the web naturally tends to produce.Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the web. That idea is almost as old as the web. But the first time around it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets. Java has since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996 the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software. Instead of desktop applications, you&rsquo;d run Java &ldquo;applets&rdquo; delivered from a server.This plan collapsed under its own weight. Microsoft helped kill it, but it would have died anyway. There was no uptake among hackers. When you find PR firms promoting something as the next development platform, you can be sure it&rsquo;s not. If it were, you wouldn&rsquo;t need PR firms to tell you, because hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites like Busmonster used Google Maps as a platform before Google even meant it to be one.The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of hackers have spontaneously started building things on top of it. Mikey likes it.There&rsquo;s another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common. Here&rsquo;s a clue. Suppose you approached investors with the following idea for a Web 2.0 startup: Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to &ldquo;tag&rdquo; content with descriptive tokens. But there is also huge source of implicit tags that they ignore: the text within web links. Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the reputation of each member. We plan to mine the web for these implicit tags, and use them together with the reputation hierarchy they embody to enhance web searches. How long do you think it would take them on average to realize that it was a description of Google?Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.0: their core business sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.0 terms, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t maltreat users&rdquo; is a subset of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil,&rdquo; and of course Google set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps.Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used, and Google does. That&rsquo;s their secret. They&rsquo;re sailing with the wind, instead of sitting becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and the record labels. [7]Google doesn&rsquo;t try to force things to happen their way. They try to figure out what&rsquo;s going to happen, and arrange to be standing there when it does. That&rsquo;s the way to approach technology—and as business includes an ever larger technological component, the right way to do business.The fact that Google is a &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; company shows that, while meaningful, the term is also rather bogus. It&rsquo;s like the word &ldquo;allopathic.&rdquo; It just means doing things right, and it&rsquo;s a bad sign when you have a special word for that. Notes[1] From the conference site, June 2004: &ldquo;While the first wave of the Web was closely tied to the browser, the second wave extends applications across the web and enables a new generation of services and business opportunities.&rdquo; To the extent this means anything, it seems to be about web-based applications.[2] Disclosure: Reddit was funded by Y Combinator. But although I started using it out of loyalty to the home team, I&rsquo;ve become a genuine addict. While we&rsquo;re at it, I&rsquo;m also an investor in !MSFT, having sold all my shares earlier this year.[3] I&rsquo;m not against editing. I spend more time editing than writing, and I have a group of picky friends who proofread almost everything I write. What I dislike is editing done after the fact by someone else.[4] Obvious is an understatement. Users had been climbing in through the window for years before Apple finally moved the door.[5] Hint: the way to create a web-based alternative to Office may not be to write every component yourself, but to establish a protocol for web-based apps to share a virtual home directory spread across multiple servers. Or it may be to write it all yourself.[6] In Jessica Livingston&rsquo;s Founders at Work.[7] Microsoft didn&rsquo;t sue their customers directly, but they seem to have done all they could to help SCO sue them.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Peter Norvig, Aaron Swartz, and Jeff Weiner for reading drafts of this, and to the guys at O&rsquo;Reilly and Adaptive Path for answering my questions.Interview About Web 2.0Spanish TranslationGerman TranslationRussian TranslationJapanese Translation If you liked this, you may also like Hackers &amp; Painters.</p>

<p>The Future of Web Startups Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. October 2007(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)There&rsquo;s something interesting happening right now. Startups are undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes cheaper.It&rsquo;s a pattern we see over and over in technology. Initially there&rsquo;s some device that&rsquo;s very expensive and made in small quantities. Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.Computers are a familiar example. When I was a kid, computers were big, expensive machines built one at a time. Now they&rsquo;re a commodity. Now we can stick computers in everything.This pattern is very old. Most of the turning points in economic history are instances of it. It happened to steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s. It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance. Agriculture itself was an instance of this pattern.Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern is happening to startups. It&rsquo;s so cheap to start web startups that orders of magnitudes more will be started. If the pattern holds true, that should cause dramatic changes.1. Lots of StartupsSo my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty straightforward: there will be a lot of them. When starting a startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors to do it. Now the only threshold is courage.Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take the plunge and survive. In the last batch of startups we funded, we had several founders who said they&rsquo;d thought of applying before, but weren&rsquo;t sure and got jobs instead. It was only after hearing reports of friends who&rsquo;d done it that they decided to try it themselves.Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too, and in some ways a worse kind of hard. In a startup you have lots of worries, but you don&rsquo;t have that feeling that your life is flying by like you do in a big company. Plus in a startup you could make much more money.As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow to a point that would now seem surprising.We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this is the thinnest of historical veneers. Just two or three lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized countries lived by farming. So while it may seem surprising to propose that large numbers of people will change the way they make a living, it would be more surprising if they didn&rsquo;t.2. StandardizationWhen technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization always follows. When you make things in large volumes you tend to standardize everything that doesn&rsquo;t need to change.At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to standardize everything. We could hire employees, but we want to be forced to figure out how to scale investing.We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, then let the needs of the users determine what to do next. In essense, let the market design the product. We&rsquo;ve done the same thing ourselves. We think of the techniques we&rsquo;re developing for dealing with large numbers of startups as like software. Sometimes it literally is software, like Hacker News and our application system.One of the most important things we&rsquo;ve been working on standardizing are investment terms. Till now investment terms have been individually negotiated. This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money take longer and cost more in legal fees. So as well as using the same paperwork for every deal we do, we&rsquo;ve commissioned generic angel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future rounds.Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms. Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will be custom deals for the forseeable future. But I think angel rounds will start to be done mostly with standardized agreements. An angel who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement is probably not one you want anyway.3. New Attitude to AcquisitionAnother thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions. As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little more work than hiring someone.Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology. They buy a lot of startups— more than most people realize, because they only announce a fraction of them. And being Google, they&rsquo;re figuring out how to do it efficiently.One problem they&rsquo;ve solved is how to think about acquisitions. For most companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy. Companies do them because they have to, but there&rsquo;s usually some feeling they shouldn&rsquo;t have to—that their own programmers should be able to build everything they need.Google&rsquo;s example should cure the rest of the world of this idea. Google has by far the best programmers of any public technology company. If they don&rsquo;t have a problem doing acquisitions, the others should have even less problem. However many Google does, Microsoft should do ten times as many.One reason Google doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with acquisitions is that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get that way. Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding no takers. They&rsquo;ve been the guys coming in to visit the big company, so they know who might be sitting across that conference table from them.4. Riskier Strategies are PossibleRisk is always proportionate to reward. The way to get really big returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding. Founders and investors have different attitudes to risk. Knowing that risk is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies, while founders, who don&rsquo;t have a big enough sample size to care what&rsquo;s true on average, tend to be more conservative.If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because founders can start them younger, when it&rsquo;s rational to take more risk, and can start more startups total in their careers. When founders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the world in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors. And that means the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, because strategies can be riskier.5. Younger, Nerdier FoundersIf startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to have them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessors made them cheap. And in particular, younger and more technical founders will be able to start startups than could before.Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince investors to let you do it. And that required very different skills from actually doing the startup. If investors were perfect judges, the two would require exactly the same skills. But unfortunately most investors are terrible judges. I know because I see behind the scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money, and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely proportional to the judgement of the buyers.Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there&rsquo;s another way to convince investors. Instead of going to venture capitalists with a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, you can get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollars of seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with a working company instead of a plan for one. Then instead of having to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to Alexa.This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who often went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortable with the amount of fakeness required in other fields.6. Startup Hubs Will PersistIt might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the end of startup hubs like Silicon Valley. If all you need to start a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.This is kind of true and kind of false. It&rsquo;s true that you can now start a startup anywhere. But you have to do more with a startup than just start it. You have to make it succeed. And that is more likely to happen in a startup hub.I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the increasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase the importance of startup hubs. The value of startup hubs, like centers for any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned: face to face meetings. No technology in the immediate future will replace walking down University Ave and running into a friend who tells you how to fix a bug that&rsquo;s been bothering you all weekend, or visiting a friend&rsquo;s startup down the street and ending up in a conversation with one of their investors.The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question of whether to take outside investment. The question is not whether you need it, but whether it brings any advantage at all. Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors an advantage over you if they do it and you don&rsquo;t. So if you hear someone saying &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need to be in Silicon Valley,&rdquo; that use of the word &ldquo;need&rdquo; is a sign they&rsquo;re not even thinking about the question right.And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing cheapness of starting a startup means the particles they&rsquo;re attracting are getting lighter. A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year old guys. A company like that can move much more easily than one with 10 people, half of whom have kids.We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem. The advantage of being able to work together face to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving. Ask anyone who&rsquo;s done it.The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a national business. One of the most common emails we get is from people asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator. But this just wouldn&rsquo;t work. Seed funding isn&rsquo;t regional, just as big research universities aren&rsquo;t.Is seed funding not merely national, but international? Interesting question. There are signs it may be. We&rsquo;ve had an ongoing stream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to do particularly well, because they&rsquo;re all people who were so determined to succeed that they were willing to move to another country to do it.The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new silicon valleys. If startups are mobile, the best local talent will go to the real Silicon Valley, and all they&rsquo;ll get at the local one will be the people who didn&rsquo;t have the energy to move.This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally. It&rsquo;s cities that compete, not countries. Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.7. Better Judgement NeededIf the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people whose job is to judge them are going to have to get better at it. I&rsquo;m thinking particularly of investors and acquirers. We now get on the order of 1000 applications a year. What are we going to do if we get 10,000?That&rsquo;s actually an alarming idea. But we&rsquo;ll figure out some kind of answer. We&rsquo;ll have to. It will probably involve writing some software, but fortunately we can do that.Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners. They generally do better than investors, because they pick later, when there&rsquo;s more performance to measure. But even at the most advanced acquirers, identifying companies to buy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition often involves a great deal of unneccessary friction.I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers who will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen. At the moment those two functions are separate. Promising new startups are often discovered by developers. If someone powerful enough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys to negotiate. It would be better if both were combined in one group, headed by someone with a technical background and some vision of what they wanted to accomplish. Maybe in the future big companies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible for technology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringing technology in from outside.At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in trouble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they could have bought earlier for $20 million. There should start to be someone who gets in trouble for that.8. College Will ChangeIf the best hackers start their own companies after college instead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college. Most of these changes will be for the better. I think the experience of college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward you&rsquo;ll be judged by potential employers.One change will be in the meaning of &ldquo;after college,&rdquo; which will switch from when one graduates from college to when one leaves it. If you&rsquo;re starting your own company, why do you need a degree? We don&rsquo;t encourage people to start startups during college, but the best founders are certainly capable of it. Some of the most successful companies we&rsquo;ve funded were started by undergrads.I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important, so I&rsquo;m alarmed to be saying things like this, but there&rsquo;s nothing magical about a degree. There&rsquo;s nothing that magically changes after you take that last exam. The importance of degrees is due solely to the administrative needs of large organizations. These can certainly affect your life—it&rsquo;s hard to get into grad school, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate degree—but tests like this will matter less and less.As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will also start to matter less where they go to college. In a startup you&rsquo;re judged by users, and they don&rsquo;t care where you went to college. So in a world of startups, elite universities will play less of a role as gatekeepers. In the US it&rsquo;s a national scandal how easily children of rich parents game college admissions. But the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by reforming the universities but by going around them. We in the technology world are used to that sort of solution: you don&rsquo;t beat the incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhaps even the classes so much as the people you meet. If it becomes common to start a startup after college, students may start trying to maximize this. Instead of focusing on getting internships at companies they want to work for, they may start to focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.What students do in their classes will change too. Instead of trying to get good grades to impress future employers, students will try to learn things. We&rsquo;re talking about some pretty dramatic changes here.9. Lots of CompetitorsIf it gets easier to start a startup, it&rsquo;s easier for competitors too. That doesn&rsquo;t erase the advantage of increased cheapness, however. You&rsquo;re not all playing a zero-sum game. There&rsquo;s not some fixed number of startups that can succeed, regardless of how many are started.In fact, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any limit to the number of startups that could succeed. Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is the satisfaction of people&rsquo;s desires. And people&rsquo;s desires seem to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won&rsquo;t be able to sit on a good idea. Other people have your idea, and they&rsquo;ll be increasingly likely to do something about it.10. Faster AdvancesThere&rsquo;s a good side to that, at least for consumers of technology. If people get right to work implementing ideas instead of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like the punctuated equilibrium model of evolution. There are some kinds of ideas that are so threatening that it&rsquo;s hard for big companies even to think of them. Look at what a hard time Microsoft is having discovering web apps. They&rsquo;re like a character in a movie that everyone in the audience can see something bad is about to happen to, but who can&rsquo;t see it himself. The big innovations that happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster if the rate of new companies increases.But in fact there will be a double speed increase. People won&rsquo;t wait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas will increasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies. Which means technology will evolve faster per company as well.Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast. I talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired by a big company. He was a precise sort of guy, so he&rsquo;d measured their productivity before and after. He counted lines of code, which can be a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it was the same group of programmers. He found they were one thirteenth as productive after the acquisition.The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one. I think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness. I experienced this myself, and his number sounds about right. There&rsquo;s something about big companies that just sucks the energy out of you.Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use. There is an enormous latent capacity in the world&rsquo;s hackers that most people don&rsquo;t even realize is there. That&rsquo;s the main reason we do Y Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy for hackers to start their own startups.A Series of TubesThe process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing in an old house. The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks in every joint. In the future this mess will gradually be replaced by a single, huge pipe. The water will still have to get from A to B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying out through some random leak.This will change a lot of things for the better. In a big, straight pipe like that, the force of being measured by one&rsquo;s performance will propagate back through the whole system. Performance is always the ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now that most people are insulated from it most of the time. So you end up with a world in which high school students think they need to get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students think they need to get good grades to impress employers, within which the employees waste most of their time in political battles, and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so few choices. Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe. Then the effects of being measured by performance would propagate all the way back to high school, flushing out all the arbitrary stuff people are measured by now. That is the future of web startups.Thanks to Brian Oberkirch and Simon Willison for inviting me to speak, and the crew at Carson Systems for making everything run smoothly.Japanese Translation</p>

<p>Weird Languages August 2021When people say that in their experience all programming languages are basically equivalent, they&rsquo;re making a statement not about languages but about the kind of programming they&rsquo;ve done.99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one can easily spend one&rsquo;s whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.Weird languages aren&rsquo;t weird by accident. Not the good ones, at least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that&rsquo;s not just the usual gluing together of library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They&rsquo;re not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it&rsquo;s just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn&rsquo;t previously say, you&rsquo;ll probably be learning how to think things you couldn&rsquo;t previously think.

<p>When To Do What You Love September 2024There&rsquo;s some debate about whether it&rsquo;s a good idea to &ldquo;follow your passion.&rdquo; In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn&rsquo;t, but the border between should and shouldn&rsquo;t is very complicated. The only way to give a general answer is to trace it.When people talk about this question, there&rsquo;s always an implicit &ldquo;instead of.&rdquo; All other things being equal, why wouldn&rsquo;t you work on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies that all other things aren&rsquo;t equal, and that you have to choose between working on what interests you the most and something else, like what pays the best.And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can&rsquo;t usually afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for doing what they want, not what you want. But there&rsquo;s an obvious exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you love football, and you&rsquo;re good enough at it, you can get paid a lot to play it.Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you shouldn&rsquo;t try though. It depends how much ability you have and how hard you&rsquo;re willing to work.The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like something that pays well and that few other people like. For example, it&rsquo;s clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company. He didn&rsquo;t just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed, but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can&rsquo;t help noticing when something is mispriced, and can&rsquo;t help doing something about it. It&rsquo;s like a puzzle for them. [1]In fact there&rsquo;s an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really huge amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars — it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent way to discover startup ideas.Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas tend to be such outliers that you&rsquo;d overlook them if you were consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you&rsquo;re young and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to be built.So there&rsquo;s something like a midwit peak for making money. If you don&rsquo;t need to make much, you can work on whatever you&rsquo;re most interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can&rsquo;t usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you&rsquo;re young and good at technology, working on what you&rsquo;re most interested in becomes a good idea again.What if you&rsquo;re not sure what you want? What if you&rsquo;re attracted to the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break ties?The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent. When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and making money, it&rsquo;s never because you have complete knowledge of yourself and of the types of work you&rsquo;re choosing between, and the options are perfectly balanced. When you can&rsquo;t decide which path to take, it&rsquo;s almost always due to ignorance. In fact you&rsquo;re usually suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don&rsquo;t know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really like, or how well you could do them. [2]In a way this ignorance is excusable. It&rsquo;s often hard to predict these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you&rsquo;re ambitious you&rsquo;re told you should go to college, and this is good advice so far as it goes, but that&rsquo;s where it usually ends. No one tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can be.What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you&rsquo;re interested in. That will get you more information about how interested you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they offer for ambition.Don&rsquo;t wait. Don&rsquo;t wait till the end of college to figure out what to work on. Don&rsquo;t even wait for internships during college. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve, the sooner you start, the better.One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at who your colleagues will be. You&rsquo;ll become like whoever you work with. Do you want to become like these people?Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well it pays, you&rsquo;ll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you&rsquo;re genuinely interested in, you&rsquo;ll be surrounded mostly by other people who are genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring. [3]The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do, the more important it is to choose options that give you more options in the future. I call this &ldquo;staying upwind.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re unsure whether to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch later from math to economics than from economics to math.There&rsquo;s one case, though, where it&rsquo;s easy to say whether you should work on what interests you the most: if you want to do great work. This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is a necessary one.There&rsquo;s a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to &ldquo;follow your passion,&rdquo; and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who&rsquo;s famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you that you have to work on what you&rsquo;re most interested in. And this is in fact true.That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the right advice for everyone. Not everyone can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort of ambitious curiosity, and you can&rsquo;t manufacture that.Notes[1] These examples show why it&rsquo;s a mistake to assume that economic inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness. It&rsquo;s obvious that different people have different interests, and that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality is the natural outcome.[2] Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter. That&rsquo;s not always due to ignorance. It&rsquo;s often intrinsically difficult. I still have trouble doing it.[3] You can&rsquo;t always take people at their word on this. Since it&rsquo;s more prestigious to work on things you&rsquo;re interested in than to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought experiment: if their work didn&rsquo;t pay well, would they take day jobs doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically lots have. But I don&rsquo;t think as many investment bankers would.This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between university departments.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Why YC March 2006, rev August 2009Yesterday one of the founders we funded asked me why we started Y Combinator. Or more precisely, he asked if we&rsquo;d started YC mainly for fun.Kind of, but not quite. It is enormously fun to be able to work with Rtm and Trevor again. I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and for all the years after I always had a background process running, looking for something we could do together. There is definitely an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator. Every couple days I slip and call it &ldquo;Viaweb.&ldquo;Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money. I was sick of living from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just work as hard as I could till I&rsquo;d made enough to solve the problem once and for all. Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn&rsquo;t designed for fun, and mostly it wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d be surprised if any startup is. All startups are mostly schleps.The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor virtuous. We didn&rsquo;t start it mainly to make money; we have no idea what our average returns might be, and won&rsquo;t know for years. Nor did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though we do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been doing something unselfish. (It&rsquo;s oddly nondeterministic.)The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a hacker would understand. We did it because it seems such a great hack. There are thousands of smart people who could start companies and don&rsquo;t, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new startups that might otherwise not have existed.In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good thing. But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more efficiently. In this case, the device is the world&rsquo;s economy, which fortunately happens to be open source.</p>

		<h1 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h1>
<p>Is It Worth Being Wise? February 2007A few days ago I finally figured out something I&rsquo;ve wondered about for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence. Anyone can see they&rsquo;re not the same by the number of people who are smart, but not very wise. And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem related. How?What is wisdom? I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s knowing what to do in a lot of situations. I&rsquo;m not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word. A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn&rsquo;t being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations? For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones. But that isn&rsquo;t true. Some wisdom has nothing to do with people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain structures are less prone to failure than others. And certainly smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well as abstract ones. [2]Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience while intelligence is innate. But people are not simply wise in proportion to how much experience they have. Other things must contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a reflective disposition, for example.Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny. So what is the difference? If we look at how people use the words &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.Curve&quot;Wise&quot; and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; are both ways of saying someone knows what to do. The difference is that &ldquo;wise&rdquo; means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; means one does spectacularly well in a few. That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person would have high peaks.The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its worst. Except you judge intelligence at its best, and wisdom by its average. That&rsquo;s how the two are related: they&rsquo;re the two different senses in which the same curve can be high.So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could. We need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where someone knows what to do because they have inside information. [3] But aside from that, I don&rsquo;t think we can get much more specific without starting to be mistaken.Nor do we need to. Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence. Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome. And it seems natural that a high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there&rsquo;s no such thing. &ldquo;Wise&rdquo; means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice. But giving the name &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn&rsquo;t mean such a thing exists. To the extent &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy. [4]Likewise, though &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; means something, we&rsquo;re asking for trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called &ldquo;intelligence.&rdquo; And whatever its components, they&rsquo;re not all innate. We use the word &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; as an indication of ability: a smart person can grasp things few others could. It does seem likely there&rsquo;s some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence.One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable. A quality that&rsquo;s inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that&rsquo;s influenced by experience, and thus might vary in the course of a study. The problem comes when we drag the word &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; over onto what they&rsquo;re measuring. If they&rsquo;re measuring something inborn, they can&rsquo;t be measuring intelligence. Three year olds aren&rsquo;t smart. When we describe one as smart, it&rsquo;s shorthand for &ldquo;smarter than other three year olds.&ldquo;SplitPerhaps it&rsquo;s a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence. But it&rsquo;s an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases. If there&rsquo;s just one point, they&rsquo;re identical: the average and maximum are the same. But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge. And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations.In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do. Distinguishing between &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; is a modern habit. [5] And the reason we do is that they&rsquo;ve been diverging. As knowledge gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels.One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete. At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence. But the really striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have to decide which we prefer. We may not be able to optimize for both simultaneously.Society seems to have voted for intelligence. We no longer admire the sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago. Now we admire the genius. Because in fact the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart. That doesn&rsquo;t sound especially admirable. That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math.Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive. In fact, a high average may help support high peaks. But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them. One is the example of very smart people, who are so often unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception. Perhaps the absent-minded professor is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he&rsquo;s not wise in the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. [6]NewFor both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were necessarily related. The wise man was someone who knew what the right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he&rsquo;d done the best he could. I can&rsquo;t think of many ancient philosophers who would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.&ldquo;The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,&rdquo; said Confucius. [7]Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he hadn&rsquo;t made enough progress. [8] The Chinese and Greek words we translate as &ldquo;happy&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t mean exactly what we do by it, but there&rsquo;s enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.Is the mathematician a small man because he&rsquo;s discontented? No; he&rsquo;s just doing a kind of work that wasn&rsquo;t very common in Confucius&rsquo;s day.Human knowledge seems to grow fractally. Time after time, something that seemed a small and uninteresting area—experimental error, even—turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in it as all knowledge up to that point. Several of the fractal buds that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and discovering new things. Math, for example, used to be something a handful of people did part-time. Now it&rsquo;s the career of thousands. And in work that involves making new things, some old rules don&rsquo;t apply.Recently I&rsquo;ve spent some time advising people, and there I find the ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience, and then don&rsquo;t worry about it, knowing you did all you could. But I don&rsquo;t have anything like this serenity when I&rsquo;m writing an essay. Then I&rsquo;m worried. What if I run out of ideas? And when I&rsquo;m writing, four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn&rsquo;t get enough done.Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of work. When people come to you with a problem and you have to figure out the right thing to do, you don&rsquo;t (usually) have to invent anything. You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which is the prudent choice. But prudence can&rsquo;t tell me what sentence to write next. The search space is too big.Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things. Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration. And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented. In that respect they&rsquo;re more like the small man of Confucius&rsquo;s day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from starvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and officials, they&rsquo;re at the mercy of their own imagination.LimitsTo me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. If I was any good, why didn&rsquo;t I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have? But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?&rdquo; Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds.People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner. There&rsquo;s no way for them to do the best they can, because there&rsquo;s no limit to what they could do. The closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people. But the better you do, the less this matters. An undergrad who gets something published feels like a star. But for someone at the top of the field, what&rsquo;s the test of doing well? Runners can at least compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you think you could have run a bit faster. But what is a novelist to do?Whereas if you&rsquo;re doing the kind of work in which problems are presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives, there&rsquo;s an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every time. In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of this type. The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything. In principle they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren&rsquo;t expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score goals. [9] In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision in every situation, and if you made it you&rsquo;d done your job perfectly, just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is considered to have played a perfect game.In this world, wisdom seemed paramount. [10] Even now, most people do work in which problems are put before them and they have to choose the best alternative. But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded. Intelligence has become increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.RecipesAnother sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their recipes are. Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from cultivating them.Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a remedial character. To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one&rsquo;s head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff. Both self-control and experience have this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively. That&rsquo;s not all wisdom is, but it&rsquo;s a large part of it. Much of what&rsquo;s in the sage&rsquo;s head is also in the head of every twelve year old. The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old it&rsquo;s mixed together with a lot of random junk.The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems. You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through exercise. But there can&rsquo;t be too much compulsion here. No amount of discipline can replace genuine curiosity. So cultivating intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one&rsquo;s character—some tendency to be interested in certain types of things—and nurturing it. Instead of obliterating your idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into a tree.The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people tend to be smart in distinctive ways.Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they&rsquo;re trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom. Most recipes for wisdom have an element of subjection. At the very least, you&rsquo;re supposed to do what the teacher says. The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does. But that&rsquo;s not the route to intelligence. Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep working. Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.(The reason it&rsquo;s hard to learn new skills late in life is not just that one&rsquo;s brain is less malleable. Another probably even worse obstacle is that one has higher standards.)I realize we&rsquo;re on dangerous ground here. I&rsquo;m not proposing the primary goal of education should be to increase students&rsquo; &ldquo;self-esteem.&rdquo; That just breeds laziness. And in any case, it doesn&rsquo;t really fool the kids, not the smart ones. They can tell at a young age that a contest where everyone wins is a fraud.A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to come up with things on their own, but you can&rsquo;t simply applaud everything they produce. You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed. And that&rsquo;s a lot of work. You have to have a good enough grasp of kids&rsquo; capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised.That&rsquo;s the opposite of traditional recipes for education. Traditionally the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student&rsquo;s job is not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material. (The use of the term &ldquo;recitation&rdquo; for sections in some colleges is a fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that they&rsquo;re too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.DifferentI deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it&rsquo;s worth being wise. But I think it&rsquo;s important to understand the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what seems to be the growing gap between them. That way we can avoid applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant for wisdom. These two senses of &ldquo;knowing what to do&rdquo; are more different than most people realize. The path to wisdom is through discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence. Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.That&rsquo;s particularly worth remembering. A physicist friend recently told me half his department was on Prozac. Perhaps if we acknowledge that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds of work, we can mitigate its effects. Perhaps we can box it up and put it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together with everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large pool. At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about being discontented.If you feel exhausted, it&rsquo;s not necessarily because there&rsquo;s something wrong with you. Maybe you&rsquo;re just running fast.Notes[1] Gauss was supposedly asked this when he was 10. Instead of laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students, he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100 + 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get the answer, 5050.[2] A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions. But while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom and intelligence, it&rsquo;s not the distinction between them. Wisdom is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in deciding what to do with the solutions.[3] In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out some knowledge. People who know the combination of a safe will be better at opening it than people who don&rsquo;t, but no one would say that was a test of intelligence or wisdom.But knowledge overlaps with wisdom and probably also intelligence. A knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom. So where do we draw the line?Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point has a sharp drop in utility. For example, understanding French will help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops sharply as soon as no one else involved knows French. Whereas the value of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.The knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has little relation to other knowledge. This includes mere conventions, like languages and safe combinations, and also what we&rsquo;d call &ldquo;random&rdquo; facts, like movie stars&rsquo; birthdays, or how to distinguish 1956 from 1957 Studebakers.[4] People seeking some single thing called &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; have been fooled by grammar. Wisdom is just knowing the right thing to do, and there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in that. Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might come from going to drunken parties.Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people&rsquo;s eyes. The mystery comes mostly from looking for something that doesn&rsquo;t exist. And the reason there have historically been so many different schools of thought about how to achieve wisdom is that they&rsquo;ve focused on different components of it.When I use the word &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; in this essay, I mean no more than whatever collection of qualities helps people make the right choice in a wide variety of situations.[5] Even in English, our sense of the word &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; is surprisingly recent. Predecessors like &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; seem to have had a broader meaning.[6] There is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks attributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions. I&rsquo;m using these names as we use the name &ldquo;Homer,&rdquo; to mean the hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.[7] Analects VII:36, Fung trans.Some translators use &ldquo;calm&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; One source of difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different idea of happiness from many older societies. Every language probably has a word meaning &ldquo;how one feels when things are going well,&rdquo; but different cultures react differently when things go well. We react like children, with smiles and laughter. But in a more reserved society, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a quiet contentment.[8] It may have been Andrew Wiles, but I&rsquo;m not sure. If anyone remembers such an interview, I&rsquo;d appreciate hearing from you.[9] Confucius claimed proudly that he had never invented anything—that he had simply passed on an accurate account of ancient traditions. [Analects VII:1] It&rsquo;s hard for us now to appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate societies to remember and pass on the group&rsquo;s accumulated knowledge. Even in Confucius&rsquo;s time it still seems to have been the first duty of the scholar.[10] The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about such matters. The few people who did invent things, like storytellers, must have seemed an outlying data point that could be ignored.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Polish TranslationFrench TranslationRussian TranslationRussian Translation</p>
