		<h1 id="woke">Woke</h1>
<p>The Origins of Wokeness January 2025The word &ldquo;prig&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t very common now, but if you look up the definition, it will sound familiar. Google&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t bad: A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others. This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and its age is an important clue: it shows that although wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it&rsquo;s an instance of a much older one.There&rsquo;s a certain kind of person who&rsquo;s attracted to a shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every society has these people. All that changes is the rules they enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In Stalin&rsquo;s Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the woke, it&rsquo;s social justice.So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs. The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to ask when and where wokeness began.The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally peaking after the riots of 2020.What was political correctness, exactly? I&rsquo;m often asked to define both this term and wokeness by people who think they&rsquo;re meaningless labels, so I will. They both have the same definition: An aggressively performative focus on social justice. In other words, it&rsquo;s people being prigs about social justice. And that&rsquo;s the real problem — the performativeness, not the social justice. [0]Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one. I don&rsquo;t think any reasonable person would deny that. The problem with political correctness was not that it focused on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for using the wrong words to talk about them.As for where political correctness began, if you think about it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin outside universities and spread to them from this external source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and spread from there to the humanities and social sciences? Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the humanities and social sciences.Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and social sciences in the 1980s?A successful theory of the origin of political correctness has to be able to explain why it didn&rsquo;t happen earlier. Why didn&rsquo;t it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s, for example? They were concerned with much the same issues. [1]The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn&rsquo;t lead to political correctness was precisely that — they were student movements. They didn&rsquo;t have any real power. The students may have been talking a lot about women&rsquo;s liberation and black power, but it was not what they were being taught in their classes. Not yet.But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s began to finish their dissertations and get hired as professors. At first they were neither powerful nor numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the previous generation of professors started to retire, they gradually became both.The reason political correctness began in the humanities and social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as a physics professor could still attend protests, but his political beliefs wouldn&rsquo;t affect his work. Whereas research in sociology and modern literature can be made as political as you like. [2]I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in 1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if someone said something they considered sexist, but no one was getting reported for it. It was still not a thing when I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in 1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade campus life.What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were the late 1980s the point at which protests against male chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal complaints to university authorities about sexism? Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the Establishment they&rsquo;d protested against two decades before. Now they were in a position not just to speak out about their ideas, but to enforce them.A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time. It wasn&rsquo;t simply a grass-roots student movement. It was faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty members. In that respect it was like the Cultural Revolution. That wasn&rsquo;t a grass-roots movement either; that was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events. I don&rsquo;t know if it actually was, but people thought it was, and that means the similarities were obvious. [3]College students larp. It&rsquo;s their nature. It&rsquo;s usually harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette, superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the phrase &ldquo;people of color&rdquo; is considered particularly enlightened, but saying &ldquo;colored people&rdquo; gets you fired. And why exactly one isn&rsquo;t supposed to use the word &ldquo;negro&rdquo; now, even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his speeches. There are no underlying principles. You&rsquo;d just have to give him a long list of rules to memorize. [4] The danger of these rules was not just that they created land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the world, but as long as you&rsquo;re orthodox you&rsquo;re better than everyone who isn&rsquo;t. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to bad people.But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated, and frequently changing rules of political correctness made it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result was a world in which good people who weren&rsquo;t up to date on current moral fashions were brought down by people whose characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see them.One big contributing factor in the rise of political correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to enforce. A new set of rules was just what they&rsquo;d been waiting for.Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped create the conditions in which the intolerant side prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old, easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally intolerant to be intolerant about.Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn&rsquo;t be on the side of the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s and thinking &ldquo;what will those people go on about now?&rdquo; As it turned out the answer was right under my nose.One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of political correctness was that it was more popular with women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was another more specific reason women tended to be the enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were the point when the definition of sexual harassment was expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a &ldquo;hostile environment.&rdquo; Within universities the classic form of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a professor made her &ldquo;feel uncomfortable.&rdquo; But the vagueness of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those make people uncomfortable too. [5]Was it sexist to propose that Darwin&rsquo;s greater male variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel &ldquo;physically ill&rdquo; and that she had to leave halfway through. If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem plausible that greater male variability explains some of the variation in human performance. So which should prevail, comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere, it should be in universities; that&rsquo;s supposed to be their specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn&rsquo;t exist. [6]Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless, can&rsquo;t respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same thing to political correctness.Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly. After all, the forces that created it were still there. The professors who started it were now becoming deans and department heads. And in addition to their departments there were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of university administrators, many of whose jobs involved enforcing various forms of political correctness.In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst into flame anew. There were several differences between this new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It spread further into the real world, although it still burned hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political correctness there were really only three things people got accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which could be made to stick.The second phase was, in multiple senses, political correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My guess is that it was due to the rise of social media, particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most distinctive features of the second wave of political correctness was the cancel mob: a mob of angry people uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired. Indeed this second wave of political correctness was originally called &ldquo;cancel culture&rdquo;; it didn&rsquo;t start to be called &ldquo;wokeness&rdquo; till the 2020s.One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to like being outraged. We&rsquo;re so used to this idea now that we take it for granted, but really it&rsquo;s pretty strange. Being outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn&rsquo;t expect people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to 2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote something if it outraged them.This tilt toward outrage wasn&rsquo;t due to wokeness. It&rsquo;s an inherent feature of social media, or at least this generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness. [7]It wasn&rsquo;t just public social networks that drove the rise of wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical, especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.Another contributing factor in this second wave of political correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn&rsquo;t regard this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced it as their duty as a paper of record — as one of the big newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times, reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral point of view.When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other sources of news were limited, but also because they did make some effort to be neutral.Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print. [8] When your market was determined by geography, you had to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained in business fell in the direction they&rsquo;d already been leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times announced that &ldquo;The paper is in the midst of an evolution from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of great narratives.&rdquo; [9] Meanwhile journalists, of a sort, had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism, which in the previous era had been one of the great centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing ones.The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new variety of journalism involving a loop through social media. Someone would say something controversial on social media. Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers would then post links to the story on social media, driving further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of clicks imaginable. You didn&rsquo;t have to maintain overseas news bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame readers further.For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren&rsquo;t the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences between the two waves of political correctness: the first was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role similar to that of the political commissars who got attached to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they weren&rsquo;t directly in the flow of the organization&rsquo;s work, but watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could often be recognized by the word &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; in their titles. Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would usually be called an &ldquo;inclusive language guide.&rdquo; [10]This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire people to keep watch for a particular type of problem, they&rsquo;re going to find it, because otherwise there&rsquo;s no justification for their existence. [11] But these bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only people who shared their political beliefs. The most egregious cases were the new &ldquo;DEI statements&rdquo; that some universities started to require from faculty candidates, proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used these statements as the initial filter and only even considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You&rsquo;re not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But this didn&rsquo;t launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017 after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein&rsquo;s history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn&rsquo;t play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did in launching political correctness.The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money: headlines during his first administration mentioned his name at about four times the rate of previous presidents.In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure I&rsquo;ve seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most people are afraid of impropriety; they&rsquo;re never exactly sure what the social rules are or which ones they might be breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since most people already worry that they might be breaking rules they don&rsquo;t know about, if you tell them they&rsquo;re breaking a rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots, eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by a much larger group, motivated by fear. They&rsquo;re not trying to signal virtue; they&rsquo;re just trying to avoid getting in trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly established. Plus its success has increased the rate of change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be breaking. So the cycle accelerates. [12]What&rsquo;s true of individuals is even more true of organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful leader. Such organizations do everything based on &ldquo;best practices.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no higher authority; if some new &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; achieves critical mass, they must adopt it. And in this case the organization can&rsquo;t do what it usually does when it&rsquo;s uncertain: delay. It might be committing improprieties right now! So it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy for a small group of zealots to capture this type of organization by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. [13]How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it, and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor right-wing ones, but without censoring either. [14] Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been permanently damaged by it. I&rsquo;m not going to claim Trump&rsquo;s second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was more charismatic; but voters&rsquo; disgust with wokeness must have helped.So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat. Obviously we should help it along. What&rsquo;s the best way to do that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came back worse than ever.In fact there&rsquo;s an even more ambitious goal: is there a way to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak of political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut off their traditional supply of rules, they&rsquo;re constantly hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we&rsquo;ll see the same phenomenon again.Let&rsquo;s start with the easier problem. Is there a simple, principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to use the customs we already have for dealing with religion. Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced by protected classes. It&rsquo;s not even the first religion of this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by the masses. [15] And we already have well-established customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You can express your own religious identity and explain your beliefs, but you can&rsquo;t call your coworkers infidels if they disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization adopt yours as its official religion.If we&rsquo;re not sure what to do about any particular manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn&rsquo;t have people whose jobs were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor writers or scientists whose work contradicts woke doctrines? No, because we wouldn&rsquo;t do this to people whose work contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an employer requiring proof of one&rsquo;s religious beliefs. Should students and employees have to participate in woke indoctrination sessions in which they&rsquo;re required to answer questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No, because we wouldn&rsquo;t dream of catechizing people in this way about their religion. [16]One shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about not wanting to watch woke movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across America several times, listening to local radio stations. Occasionally I&rsquo;d turn the dial and hear some new song. But the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I&rsquo;d turn the dial again. Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make me lose interest.But by the same token we should not automatically reject everything the woke believe. I&rsquo;m not a Christian, but I can see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn&rsquo;t share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort of thing a religious zealot would do.If we have genuine pluralism, I think we&rsquo;ll be safe from future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won&rsquo;t go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative. They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say every few months if they like, but they mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to change what we&rsquo;re allowed to say. [17]The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks of aggressively performative moralism — is of course harder. Here we&rsquo;re up against human nature. There will always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the enforcers among them, the aggressively conventional-minded. These people are born that way. Every society has them. So the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.The aggressively conventional-minded aren&rsquo;t always on the rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at once. That&rsquo;s what happened during the Cultural Revolution, and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of political correctness we&rsquo;ve experienced.We can&rsquo;t get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded. [18] And we couldn&rsquo;t prevent people from creating new ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one thing that gives them away: they define new heresies to punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful antibodies against the concept of heresy.We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something that we&rsquo;d previously been able to say, our initial assumption should be that they&rsquo;re wrong. Only our initial assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent something from being said will usually claim they&rsquo;re not merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some form of &ldquo;harm&rdquo;. And maybe they&rsquo;re right. But once again, the burden of proof is on them. It&rsquo;s not enough to claim harm; they have to prove it.As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to give themselves away by banning heresies, we&rsquo;ll always be able to notice when they become aligned behind some new ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with any luck we can stop them in their tracks.The number of true things we can&rsquo;t say should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.Notes[0] This was not the original meaning of &ldquo;woke,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s rarely used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is the dominant one.[1] Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did? One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him: The middle-class student protestors of the New Left rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse &ldquo;Theory&rdquo;. Labor politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a couple generations to work through. The woke ideology&rsquo;s conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and wokeness are cousins.The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way through the institutions because it had no interest in &ldquo;seizing the means of production&rdquo; (how quaint such phrases seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex, etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us power within your system and we&rsquo;ll bestow the resource we control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious revolutionary program would not have. [2] It helped that the humanities and social sciences also included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors. If a political movement had to start with physics students, it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of them, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have the time to spare.At the top universities these majors are not as big as they used to be, though. A 2022 survey found that only 7% of Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in English, it&rsquo;s presumably because they love the written word and not because they want to listen to lectures about racism.[3] The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students Meredith Raimondo that read &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say unleash the students if I wasn&rsquo;t convinced this needs to be put behind us.&quot;[4] The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be the only rule you&rsquo;d have to remember, and this is comically far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I still hadn&rsquo;t covered all the cases.[5] In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a hostile work environment could constitute sex discrimination, which in turn affected universities via Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person, but since for a professor merely being the subject of a sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively forbidden. Which meant we&rsquo;d now come full circle to Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of things that might not be said &ldquo;with ladies present.&quot;[6] Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict between diversity and quality. But you can&rsquo;t simultaneously optimize for two things that aren&rsquo;t identical. What diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is used, is proportional representation, and unless you&rsquo;re selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative, like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional representation has to come at the expense of quality. This is not because of anything about representation; it&rsquo;s the nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the expense of y unless x and y are identical.[7] Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a previously isolated population. I&rsquo;m fairly confident that it would be possible to create new social media apps that were less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.[8] I say &ldquo;mostly&rdquo; because I have hopes that journalistic neutrality will return in some form. There is some market for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it&rsquo;s valuable. The rich and powerful want to know what&rsquo;s really going on; that&rsquo;s how they became rich and powerful.[9] The Times made this momentous announcement very informally, in passing in the middle of an article about a Times reporter who&rsquo;d been criticized for inaccuracy. It&rsquo;s quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it&rsquo;s somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with a whimper rather than a bang.[10] As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their titles. It looks like &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; will be a popular option.[11] If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why our legal system includes protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel, the de facto parallel legal system established by Title IX makes that all too clear.[12] The invention of new improprieties is most visible in the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would do it too. So &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;enslaved individuals.&rdquo; But web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in real time: if you search for &ldquo;individuals experiencing slavery&rdquo; you will as of this writing find five legit attempts to use the phrase, and you&rsquo;ll even find two for &ldquo;individuals experiencing enslavement.&quot;[13] Organizations that do dubious things are particularly concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG ratings than Tesla.[14] Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying users lean right on average, because people on the far left dislike Elon and don&rsquo;t want to give him money. Elon presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted to.[15] It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which means unlike Christianity&rsquo;s egalitarian version, people have varying degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white American male is born with such a load of sin that only by the most abject repentance can he be saved.Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the things done in their name.[16] There is one exception to most of these rules: actual religious organizations. It&rsquo;s reasonable for them to insist on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they&rsquo;re religious organizations. It&rsquo;s rightly considered shady when something that appears to be an ordinary business or publication turns out to be a religious organization.[17] I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression that it will be simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.[18] You can however get rid of aggressively conventional-minded people within an organization, and in many if not most organizations this would be an excellent idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet you&rsquo;d feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to none.Thanks to Sam Altman, Ben Miller, Daniel Gackle, Robin Hanson, Jessica Livingston, Greg Lukianoff, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and Tim Urban for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>A Word to the Resourceful Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. January 2012A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups we&rsquo;d funded: they all seemed hard to talk to. It felt as if there was some kind of wall between us. I could never quite tell if they understood what I was saying.This caught my attention because earlier we&rsquo;d noticed a pattern among the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a different quality. We found the startups that did best were the ones with the sort of founders about whom we&rsquo;d say &ldquo;they can take care of themselves.&rdquo; The startups that do best are fire-and-forget in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they&rsquo;ll close it, whatever type of lead it is. When they&rsquo;re raising money, for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you wanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point. You won&rsquo;t have to babysit the round to make sure it happens. That type of founder is going to come back with the money; the only question is how much on what terms.It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum could be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests. You&rsquo;d expect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by the presence of quality x, at the other end they&rsquo;d be distinguished by lack of x. Was there some kind of inverse relation between resourcefulness and being hard to talk to?It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage &ldquo;a word to the wise is sufficient.&rdquo; Because this phrase is not only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending the subject to some advice), most people who&rsquo;ve heard it don&rsquo;t know what it means. What it means is that if someone is wise, all you have to do is say one word to them, and they&rsquo;ll understand immediately. You don&rsquo;t have to explain in detail; they&rsquo;ll chase down all the implications.In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort of founder a one line intro to a VC, and he&rsquo;ll chase down the money. That&rsquo;s the connection. Understanding all the implications — even the inconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset of resourcefulness. It&rsquo;s conversational resourcefulness.Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness often means doing things you don&rsquo;t want to. Chasing down all the implications of what&rsquo;s said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable conclusions. The best word to describe the failure to do so is probably &ldquo;denial,&rdquo; though that seems a bit too narrow. A better way to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessful founders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness. They traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person traverses the physical world. [1]The unsuccessful founders weren&rsquo;t stupid. Intellectually they were as capable as the successful founders of following all the implications of what one said to them. They just weren&rsquo;t eager to.So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the unsuccessful startups. It was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness. That&rsquo;s what was killing them. As well as failing to chase down the implications of what was said to them, the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding, and users, and sources of new ideas. But the most immediate evidence I had that something was amiss was that I couldn&rsquo;t talk to them.Notes[1] A YC partner wrote:My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours, they&rsquo;ve already decided what they&rsquo;re going to do and everything I say is being put through an internal process in their heads, which either desperately tries to munge what I&rsquo;ve said into something that conforms with their decision or just outright dismisses it and creates a rationalization for doing so. They may not even be conscious of this process but that&rsquo;s what I think is happening when you say something to bad groups and they have that glazed over look. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s confusion or lack of understanding per se, it&rsquo;s this internal process at work.With the good groups, you can tell that everything you say is being looked at with fresh eyes and even if it&rsquo;s dismissed, it&rsquo;s because of some logical reason e.g. &ldquo;we already tried that&rdquo; or &ldquo;from speaking to our users that isn&rsquo;t what they&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; etc. Those groups never have that glazed over look.Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Putting Ideas into Words February 2022Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn&rsquo;t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won&rsquo;t just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that&rsquo;s why I write them.Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your ideas, and now you&rsquo;ve expressed them. But you know this isn&rsquo;t true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.It&rsquo;s not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you&rsquo;ve written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what&rsquo;s in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger, and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he&rsquo;s not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn&rsquo;t qualify some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.This much, I assume, won&rsquo;t be that controversial. I think it will accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about anything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I&rsquo;ve never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned further, taps his head and says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up here.&rdquo; Everyone watching the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and incomplete. Very likely there&rsquo;s some undiscovered flaw that invalidates it completely. At best it&rsquo;s a plan for a plan.In precisely defined domains it&rsquo;s possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example. And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don&rsquo;t seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can express in a formal language. [1] Arguably what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some extent write essays in my head. I&rsquo;ll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the final version. But really I&rsquo;m writing when I do this. I&rsquo;m doing the mental part of writing; my fingers just aren&rsquo;t moving as I do it. [2]You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so much that you wouldn&rsquo;t learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ve written about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups — and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them. In both cases there were things I didn&rsquo;t consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don&rsquo;t think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.I&rsquo;m not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I&rsquo;m saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you&rsquo;ll still learn new things from writing about them.Putting ideas into words doesn&rsquo;t have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don&rsquo;t have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. I&rsquo;ll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you&rsquo;re lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill. [3]The reason I&rsquo;ve spent so long establishing this rather obvious point is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn&rsquo;t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.It feels to them as if they do, especially if they&rsquo;re not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It&rsquo;s only when you try to put them into words that you discover they&rsquo;re not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you&rsquo;ll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they&rsquo;ll be right. Far from it. But though it&rsquo;s not a sufficient condition, it is a necessary one.Notes[1] Machinery and circuits are formal languages.[2] I thought of this sentence as I was walking down the street in Palo Alto.[3] There are two senses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation is verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form, including writing. In the limit case (e.g. Seneca&rsquo;s letters), conversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing.It can be very useful to talk (in either sense) with other people as you&rsquo;re writing something. But a verbal conversation will never be more exacting than when you&rsquo;re talking about something you&rsquo;re writing.

<p>What Doesn&rsquo;t Seem Like Work? January 2015My father is a mathematician. For most of my childhood he worked for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to do. When you talk to him about his childhood, there&rsquo;s a clear watershed at about age 12, when he &ldquo;got interested in maths.&ldquo;He grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of Pwllheli. As we retraced his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been nice growing up in the country.&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it get boring when you got to be about 15?&rdquo; I asked.&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by then I was interested in maths.&ldquo;In another conversation he told me that what he really liked was solving problems. To me the exercises at the end of each chapter in a math textbook represent work, or at best a way to reinforce what you learned in that chapter. To him the problems were the reward. The text of each chapter was just some advice about solving them. He said that as soon as he got a new textbook he&rsquo;d immediately work out all the problems — to the slight annoyance of his teacher, since the class was supposed to work through the book gradually.Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on. But talking to my father reminded me of a heuristic the rest of us can use. If something that seems like work to other people doesn&rsquo;t seem like work to you, that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re well suited for. For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually like debugging. It&rsquo;s not something people tend to volunteer; one likes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like debugging to like programming, considering the degree to which programming consists of it.The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence they probably are of what you should do. When I was in college I used to write papers for my friends. It was quite interesting to write a paper for a class I wasn&rsquo;t taking. Plus they were always so relieved.It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person and pleasant to another, but I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time what this imbalance implied, because I wasn&rsquo;t looking for it. I didn&rsquo;t realize how hard it can be to decide what you should work on, and that you sometimes have to figure it out from subtle clues, like a detective solving a case in a mystery novel. So I bet it would help a lot of people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like work to other people that doesn&rsquo;t seem like work to you?

<p>What I Worked On February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn&rsquo;t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called &ldquo;data processing.&rdquo; This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district&rsquo;s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain&rsquo;s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there&rsquo;s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn&rsquo;t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn&rsquo;t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn&rsquo;t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I&rsquo;m not surprised I can&rsquo;t remember any programs I wrote, because they can&rsquo;t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn&rsquo;t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager&rsquo;s expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he&rsquo;d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn&rsquo;t plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn&rsquo;t much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn&rsquo;t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven&rsquo;t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don&rsquo;t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we&rsquo;d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren&rsquo;t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers&rsquo; ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn&rsquo;t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn&rsquo;t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence.&rdquo; When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I&rsquo;d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who&rsquo;d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.I don&rsquo;t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that&rsquo;s told &ldquo;the dog is sitting on the chair&rdquo; translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there&rsquo;s a subset of natural language that&rsquo;s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It&rsquo;s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there&rsquo;s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn&rsquo;t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn&rsquo;t last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I&rsquo;d spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn&rsquo;t become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn&rsquo;t have a boss, or even need to get research funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I&rsquo;d never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art  that it didn&rsquo;t just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.I didn&rsquo;t see a way out of this situation. I didn&rsquo;t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he&rsquo;d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn&rsquo;t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay &ldquo;Yes, I think so. I&rsquo;ll give you something to read in a few days.&ldquo;I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There&rsquo;s a whole world there that&rsquo;s barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.I&rsquo;d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they&rsquo;d sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I&rsquo;d done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don&rsquo;t know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. [2]I&rsquo;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn&rsquo;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn&rsquo;t require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they&rsquo;d seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She&rsquo;d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he&rsquo;d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can&rsquo;t move. People can&rsquo;t sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don&rsquo;t sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you&rsquo;re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you&rsquo;re seeing. You don&rsquo;t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it&rsquo;s been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it&rsquo;s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren&rsquo;t consciously aware of much we&rsquo;re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a water droplet&rdquo; without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a bush&rdquo; without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there&rsquo;s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure it&rsquo;s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn&rsquo;t teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they&rsquo;d added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I&rsquo;ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn&rsquo;t know C and didn&rsquo;t want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it&rsquo;s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it&rsquo;s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there&rsquo;s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it&rsquo;s good to be the &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you&rsquo;re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a &ldquo;schtick&rdquo;: something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else&rsquo;s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it&rsquo;s by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That&rsquo;s not always why artists have a signature style, but it&rsquo;s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who &ldquo;could draw&rdquo; in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn&rsquo;t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there&rsquo;s a tiny corner that&rsquo;s not rich, or at least wasn&rsquo;t in 1993. It&rsquo;s called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I&rsquo;d taken her painting class at Harvard. I&rsquo;ve never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn&rsquo;t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don&rsquo;t I become rich? Then I&rsquo;ll be able to work on whatever I want.Meanwhile I&rsquo;d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I&rsquo;d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can&rsquo;t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn&rsquo;t want to be online, and still don&rsquo;t, not the fancy ones. That&rsquo;s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we&rsquo;d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an &ldquo;internet storefront&rdquo; was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we&rsquo;d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert&rsquo;s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we&rsquo;d never have to write anything to run on users&rsquo; computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we&rsquo;d serve them from. Users wouldn&rsquo;t need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn&rsquo;t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn&rsquo;t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle&rsquo;s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator&rsquo;s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we&rsquo;d needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I&rsquo;d made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you&rsquo;re curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on this for a month,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s still not done.&rdquo; This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They&rsquo;re the two most independent-minded people I know, and in completely different ways. If you could see inside Rtm&rsquo;s brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor&rsquo;s it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn&rsquo;t have to integrate with any other software except Robert&rsquo;s and Trevor&rsquo;s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I&rsquo;d had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn&rsquo;t because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what&rsquo;s now called &ldquo;doing things that don&rsquo;t scale,&rdquo; although at the time we would have described it as &ldquo;being so lame that we&rsquo;re driven to the most desperate measures to get users.&rdquo; The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d&rsquo;etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man&rsquo;s shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men&rsquo;s shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by &ldquo;business&rdquo; and thought we needed a &ldquo;business person&rdquo; to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we&rsquo;d have so many users that I couldn&rsquo;t scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn&rsquo;t get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that&rsquo;s how much money you&rsquo;re making, and if you&rsquo;re not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we&rsquo;d been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you&rsquo;re doing fine. You&rsquo;re growing 7x a year. Just don&rsquo;t hire too many more people and you&rsquo;ll soon be profitable, and then you&rsquo;ll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that&rsquo;s what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn&rsquo;t reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn&rsquo;t feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo&rsquo;s prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they&rsquo;d never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I&rsquo;d painted anything that I&rsquo;d half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men&rsquo;s shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I&rsquo;d already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That&rsquo;s what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn&rsquo;t seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn&rsquo;t know many people in California. I&rsquo;d compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you&rsquo;ll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn&rsquo;t know any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn&rsquo;t been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I&rsquo;d paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn&rsquo;t rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn&rsquo;t one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn&rsquo;t think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn&rsquo;t particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he&rsquo;d made a lot of money the last time I&rsquo;d lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I&rsquo;d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it&rsquo;s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn&rsquo;t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we&rsquo;d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an &ldquo;application service provider,&rdquo; or ASP. This name didn&rsquo;t last long before it was replaced by &ldquo;software as a service,&rdquo; but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn&rsquo;t want to run a company  especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I&rsquo;d only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn&rsquo;t need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. I&rsquo;d build a subset that could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn&rsquo;t even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we&rsquo;d used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I&rsquo;d created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]Wow, I thought, there&rsquo;s an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]I&rsquo;ve worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I&rsquo;d always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they&rsquo;d seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I&rsquo;ve noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren&rsquo;t prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I&rsquo;m writing, and I explain that it&rsquo;s an essay I&rsquo;m going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It&rsquo;s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it&rsquo;s a sign both that there&rsquo;s something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren&rsquo;t prestigious doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;re on the right track, it at least guarantees you&rsquo;re not on the most common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O&rsquo;Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers &amp; Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn&rsquo;t know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn&rsquo;t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won&rsquo;t waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they&rsquo;d be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we&rsquo;d made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they&rsquo;d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I&rsquo;d only known), I blurted out &ldquo;But not me!&rdquo; and went on with the talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing. I&rsquo;d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn&rsquo;t done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We&rsquo;d start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we&rsquo;d been talking about. I&rsquo;d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we&rsquo;d get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn&rsquo;t figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn&rsquo;t go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we&rsquo;d been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking &ldquo;Wow, that means they got all the returns.&rdquo; But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn&rsquo;t know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn&rsquo;t have known where to start. [14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they&rsquo;d start startups instead? We wouldn&rsquo;t feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn&rsquo;t make much money out of it, we&rsquo;d at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.We&rsquo;d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We&rsquo;d all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after dinner we&rsquo;d bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get &ldquo;deal flow,&rdquo; as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who&rsquo;d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we&rsquo;d intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don&rsquo;t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another&rsquo;s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the &ldquo;YC GDP,&rdquo; but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn&rsquo;t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one&rsquo;s intellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I&rsquo;d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one&rsquo;s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC&rsquo;s internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn&rsquo;t have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.YC was different from other kinds of work I&rsquo;ve done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn&rsquo;t like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn&rsquo;t like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: &ldquo;No one works harder than the boss.&rdquo; He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I&rsquo;d better work very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you should make sure Y Combinator isn&rsquo;t the last cool thing you do.&ldquo;At the time I didn&rsquo;t understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life&rsquo;s work or I&rsquo;d have to leave eventually. And it wasn&rsquo;t, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn&rsquo;t, so we decided we&rsquo;d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn&rsquo;t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we&rsquo;d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he&rsquo;d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I&rsquo;m interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm&rsquo;s advice hadn&rsquo;t included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I&rsquo;d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I&rsquo;d never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I&rsquo;d always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven&rsquo;t painted since. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that&rsquo;s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it&rsquo;s getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren&rsquo;t about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn&rsquo;t originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what&rsquo;s the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]McCarthy didn&rsquo;t realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy&rsquo;s interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn&rsquo;t match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn&rsquo;t understand why at the time.McCarthy&rsquo;s 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you&rsquo;d want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren&rsquo;t defined using McCarthy&rsquo;s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn&rsquo;t have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you&rsquo;d have had to run it, and computers then weren&rsquo;t powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy&rsquo;s axiomatic approach till you&rsquo;d defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy&rsquo;s Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it&rsquo;s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I&rsquo;d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you&rsquo;re working on an interpreter written in itself, it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of what&rsquo;s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I&rsquo;d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I&rsquo;d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking &ldquo;Does Paul Graham still code?&ldquo;Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy&rsquo;s original Lisp, it&rsquo;s a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy&rsquo;s Lisp it&rsquo;s a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I&rsquo;d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who&rsquo;d lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it. Notes[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It&rsquo;s the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they&rsquo;re willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore&rsquo;s Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren&rsquo;t specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.[7] Technically the apartment wasn&rsquo;t rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it&rsquo;s done. But when the software is an online store builder and you&rsquo;re hosting the stores, if you don&rsquo;t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.[9] We&rsquo;d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn&rsquo;t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn&rsquo;t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants&rsquo; sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren&rsquo;t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don&rsquo;t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs&rsquo; customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here&rsquo;s an interesting point, though: you can&rsquo;t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn&rsquo;t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it&rsquo;s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.[15] I&rsquo;ve never liked the term &ldquo;deal flow,&rdquo; because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it&rsquo;s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you&rsquo;re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you&rsquo;re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it&rsquo;s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We&rsquo;d been working on YC almost the whole time we&rsquo;d known each other, and we&rsquo;d neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy&rsquo;s 1960 paper.But if so there&rsquo;s no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy&rsquo;s Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Writes and Write-Nots October 2024I&rsquo;m usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there won&rsquo;t be many people who can write.One of the strangest things you learn if you&rsquo;re a writer is how many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have a mole they&rsquo;re worried about; people who are good at setting up computers know how many people aren&rsquo;t; writers know how many people need help writing.The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it&rsquo;s fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard.And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the job, the more writing it tends to require.These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort at all. Which means they&rsquo;re not even halfway decent at writing.Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn&rsquo;t buy or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work.The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it. But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and those who can&rsquo;t write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can&rsquo;t write, there will just be good writers and people who can&rsquo;t write.Is that so bad? Isn&rsquo;t it common for skills to disappear when technology makes them obsolete? There aren&rsquo;t many blacksmiths left, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem.Yes, it&rsquo;s bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there&rsquo;s a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can&rsquo;t make this point better than Leslie Lamport did: If you&rsquo;re thinking without writing, you only think you&rsquo;re thinking. So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most people&rsquo;s jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be.It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Ben Miller, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Writing, Briefly March 2005 (In the process of answering an email, I accidentally wrote a tiny essay about writing. I usually spend weeks on an essay. This one took 67 minutes—23 of writing, and 44 of rewriting.)I think it&rsquo;s far more important to write well than most people realize. Writing doesn&rsquo;t just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you&rsquo;re bad at writing and don&rsquo;t like to do it, you&rsquo;ll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.As for how to write well, here&rsquo;s the short version: Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut out everything unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers you like; if you can&rsquo;t get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag; don&rsquo;t (always) make detailed outlines; mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence first; write about stuff you like; don&rsquo;t try to sound impressive; don&rsquo;t hesitate to change the topic on the fly; use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time; when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don&rsquo;t feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won&rsquo;t read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately; ask friends which sentence you&rsquo;ll regret most; go back and tone down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.Russian TranslationJapanese TranslationRomanian TranslationSpanish TranslationGerman TranslationChinese TranslationHungarian TranslationCatalan TranslationDanish TranslationArabic Translation</p>

<p>Modeling a Wealth Tax August 2020Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in addition to income and capital gains taxes. Let&rsquo;s try modeling the effects of various levels of wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startup founder.Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then live for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume?If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it&rsquo;s easy to calculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you&rsquo;ll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will over the course of your life take 45% of your stock.(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming net poorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)Here&rsquo;s how much stock the government would take over 60 years at various levels of wealth tax: wealth taxgovernment takes 0.1%6%0.5%26% 1.0%45% 2.0%70% 3.0%84% 4.0%91%5.0%95% A wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts. How much difference would a high threshold make? To model that, we need to make some assumptions about the initial value of your stock and the growth rate.Suppose your stock is initially worth $2 million, and the company&rsquo;s trajectory is as follows: the value of your stock grows 3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years, then 50% for 2 years, after which you just get a typical public company growth rate, which we&rsquo;ll call 8%. [1] Suppose the wealth tax threshold is $50 million. How much stock does the government take now? wealth taxgovernment takes 0.1%5%0.5%23% 1.0%41% 2.0%65% 3.0%79% 4.0%88%5.0%93% It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50 million threshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder&rsquo;s stock.The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they&rsquo;re applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year&rsquo;s income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will tax that same asset 60 times. A wealth tax compounds.Note[1] In practice, eventually some of this 8% would come in the form of dividends, which are taxed as income at issue, so this model actually represents the most optimistic case for the founder.</p>

		<h1 id="yahoo">Yahoo</h1>
<p>What Happened to Yahoo Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. August 2010When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998, it felt like the center of the world. It was supposed to be the next big thing. It was supposed to be what Google turned out to be.What went wrong? The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time, practically to the beginning of the company. They were already very visible when I got there in 1998. Yahoo had two problems Google didn&rsquo;t: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology company.MoneyThe first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for different reasons. He thought we were meeting so he could check us out in person before buying us. I thought we were meeting so we could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop. It was a way of sorting shopping search results. Merchants bid a percentage of sales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but by the bid times the average amount a user would buy. It was like the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the spring of 1998, before Google was founded.Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense that it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from each link. But it wasn&rsquo;t just optimal in that sense. Ranking search results by user behavior also makes search better. Users train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results get better and better.Jerry didn&rsquo;t seem to care. I was confused. I was showing him technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic, and he didn&rsquo;t care? I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether I was explaining it badly, or he was just very poker faced.I didn&rsquo;t realize the answer till later, after I went to work at Yahoo. It was neither of my guesses. The reason Yahoo didn&rsquo;t care about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that advertisers were already overpaying for it. If Yahoo merely extracted the actual value, they&rsquo;d have made less.Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads. Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads. So Yahoo&rsquo;s sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue. Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh, Yahoo&rsquo;s sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and come back with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers, for lack of any other reference, compared them to. But they were expensive compared to what they were worth. So these big, dumb companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on. But there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo&rsquo;s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; I was shouting &ldquo;Sell!&ldquo;Both the Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing brand advertising. They didn&rsquo;t care about targeting. They just wanted lots of people to see their ads. So traffic became the thing to get at Yahoo. It didn&rsquo;t matter what type. [1]It wasn&rsquo;t just Yahoo. All the search engines were doing it. This was why they were trying to get people to start calling them &ldquo;portals&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;search engines.&rdquo; Despite the actual meaning of the word portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo should buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers in the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search. He told me that it wasn&rsquo;t worth worrying about. Search was only 6% of our traffic, and we were growing at 10% a month. It wasn&rsquo;t worth doing better.I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Oh, ok.&rdquo; Because I didn&rsquo;t realize either how much search traffic was worth. I&rsquo;m not sure even Larry and Sergey did then. If they had, Google presumably wouldn&rsquo;t have expended any effort on enterprise search.If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might have realized sooner how important search was. But they had the most opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money. As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was hard to take search seriously. Google didn&rsquo;t have that to distract them.HackersBut Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to change directions. They&rsquo;d been thrown off balance from the start by their ambivalence about being a technology company.One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there was the way they insisted on calling themselves a &ldquo;media company.&rdquo; If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a software company. The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product managers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people (yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart their browsers, and so on, just like a software company. So why did they call themselves a media company?One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads. In 1995 it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way. Technology companies made money by selling their software to users. Media companies sold ads. So they must be a media company.Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft. If anyone at Yahoo considered the idea that they should be a technology company, the next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.It&rsquo;s hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear Microsoft still inspired in 1995. Imagine a company with several times the power Google has now, but way meaner. It was perfectly reasonable to be afraid of them. Yahoo watched them crush the first hot Internet company, Netscape. It was reasonable to worry that if they tried to be the next Netscape, they&rsquo;d suffer the same fate. How were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft&rsquo;s last victim?It would have been a clever move to pretend to be a media company to throw Microsoft off their scent. But unfortunately Yahoo actually tried to be one, sort of. Project managers at Yahoo were called &ldquo;producers,&rdquo; for example, and the different parts of the company were called &ldquo;properties.&rdquo; But what Yahoo really needed to be was a technology company, and by trying to be something else, they ended up being something that was neither here nor there. That&rsquo;s why Yahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they didn&rsquo;t take programming seriously enough. Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures. But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity. At Yahoo, user-facing software was controlled by product managers and designers. The job of programmers was just to take the work of the product managers and designers the final step, by translating it into code.One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things, they often weren&rsquo;t very good. But that wasn&rsquo;t the worst problem. The worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all been obsessed with hiring the best programmers. Yahoo wasn&rsquo;t. They preferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn&rsquo;t have the kind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring the smartest people that the big winners have had. And when you consider how much competition there was for programmers when they were hiring, during the Bubble, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the quality of their programmers was uneven.In technology, once you have bad programmers, you&rsquo;re doomed. I can&rsquo;t think of an instance where a company has sunk into technical mediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want to work with other good programmers. So once the quality of programmers at your company starts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no recovery. [2]At Yahoo this death spiral started early. If there was ever a time when Yahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I got there in 1998.The company felt prematurely old. Most technology companies eventually get taken over by suits and middle managers. At Yahoo it felt as if they&rsquo;d deliberately accelerated this process. They didn&rsquo;t want to be a bunch of hackers. They wanted to be suits. A media company should be run by suits.The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, the same number Yahoo had when I went to work there. But boy did things seem different. It was still very much a hacker-centric culture. I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the problem of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked &ldquo;what should we do?&rdquo; Programmers at Yahoo wouldn&rsquo;t have asked that. Theirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what product managers spec&rsquo;d. I remember coming away from Google thinking &ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s still a startup.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much we can learn from Yahoo&rsquo;s first fatal flaw. It&rsquo;s probably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged by depending on a bogus source of revenue. But startups can learn an important lesson from the second one. In the software business, you can&rsquo;t afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.Probably the most impressive commitment I&rsquo;ve heard to having a hacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at Startup School in 2007. He said that in the early days Facebook made a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that would not ordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.So which companies need to have a hacker-centric culture? Which companies are &ldquo;in the software business&rdquo; in this respect? As Yahoo discovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most people realize. The answer is: any company that needs to have good software.Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn&rsquo;t have a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others that did? I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount, or if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in it were hacker-centric. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t attract good programmers to work in a suit-centric culture. And without good programmers you won&rsquo;t get good software, no matter how many people you put on a task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure &ldquo;quality.&ldquo;Hacker culture often seems kind of irresponsible. That&rsquo;s why people proposing to destroy it use phrases like &ldquo;adult supervision.&rdquo; That was the phrase they used at Yahoo. But there are worse things than seeming irresponsible. Losing, for example. Notes[1] The closest we got to targeting when I was there was when we created pets.yahoo.com in order to provoke a bidding war between 3 pet supply startups for the spot as top sponsor.[2] In theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good programmers instead of hiring them. You can get programmers who would never have come to you as employees by buying their startups. But so far the only companies smart enough to do this are companies smart enough not to need to.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>A New Venture Animal March 2008, rev May 2013(This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figure out what we do. Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we&rsquo;re still trying to understand its implications.) I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that said &ldquo;Y Combinator does seed funding for startups.&rdquo; What was especially annoying about it was that I wrote it. This doesn&rsquo;t really convey what we do. And the reason it&rsquo;s inaccurate is that, paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about funding.Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms of earlier models. It&rsquo;s like calling a car a horseless carriage.When you scale animals you can&rsquo;t just keep everything in proportion. For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but surface area only as the square. So as animals get bigger they have trouble radiating heat. That&rsquo;s why mice and rabbits are furry and elephants and hippos aren&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t make a mouse by scaling down an elephant.YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smaller that all the rules are different.Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were venture capital funds. VCs generally fund later stage companies than we do. And they supply so much money that, even though the other things they do may be very valuable, it&rsquo;s not that inaccurate to regard VCs as sources of money. Good VCs are &ldquo;smart money,&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re still money.All good investors supply a combination of money and help. But these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do. Late stage investors supply huge amounts of money and comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost entirely about money. As you move earlier in the venture funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because earlier stage companies have different needs. Early stage companies need less money because they&rsquo;re smaller and cheaper to run, but they need more help because life is so precarious for them. So when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum. We&rsquo;re at least one and generally two steps before VC funding. (Though some startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is to do an angel round first.) And what happens at Y Combinator is as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A round is from a mezzanine financing.At our end, money is almost a negligible factor. The startup usually consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the company&rsquo;s main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their living expenses are low. But at this early stage companies need a lot of help. Practically every question is still unanswered. Some companies we&rsquo;ve funded have been working on their software for a year or more, but others haven&rsquo;t decided what to work on, or even who the founders should be.When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups after they&rsquo;ve become big, they always underestimate how uncertain things were at first. They&rsquo;re not being deliberately misleading. When you look at a company like Google, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine they could once have been small and helpless. Sure, at one point they were a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along the railroad tracks of destiny.Far from it. A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings end up failing. Google has such momentum now that it would be hard for anyone to stop them. But all it would have taken in the beginning would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong things for six months, and the company could have died.We know, because we&rsquo;ve been there, just how vulnerable startups are in the earliest phases. Curiously enough, that&rsquo;s why founders tend to get so rich from them. Reward is always proportionate to risk, and very early stage startups are insanely risky.What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight. One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier. We get startups airborne. Barely airborne, but enough that they can accelerate fast.When you&rsquo;re launching planes they have to be set up properly or you&rsquo;re just launching projectiles. They have to be pointed straight down the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines have to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready. These are the kind of problems we deal with. After we fund startups we work closely with them for three months—so closely in fact that we insist they move to where we are. And what we do in those three months is make sure everything is set up for launch. If there are tensions between cofounders we help sort them out. We get all the paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later. If the founders aren&rsquo;t sure what to focus on first, we try to figure that out. If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we either try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways. The goal is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use that time to build (or finish building) something impressive. And then near the end of the three months we push the button on the steam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.Launching companies isn&rsquo;t identical with launching products. Though we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch them before raising their next round of funding. Several of the most promising startups we&rsquo;ve funded haven&rsquo;t launched their products yet, but are definitely launched as companies.In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to answer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions. In later stage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, or organization. In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology and design. What do you make? That&rsquo;s the first problem to solve. That&rsquo;s why our motto is &ldquo;Make something people want.&rdquo; This is always a good thing for companies to do, but it&rsquo;s even more important early on, because it sets the bounds for every other question. Who you hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself—they all depend on what you&rsquo;re making.Because the early problems are so much about technology and design, you probably need to be hackers to do what we do. While some VCs have technical backgrounds, I don&rsquo;t know any who still write code. Their expertise is mostly in business—as it should be, because that&rsquo;s the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series A and (if you&rsquo;re lucky) IPO.We&rsquo;re so different from VCs that we&rsquo;re really a different kind of animal. Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this new type of venture firm? I&rsquo;m pretty sure the answer is yes, because YC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and our case was not atypical. We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money from our friend Julian. He was a lawyer and arranged all our paperwork, so we could just code. We spent three months building a version 1, which we then presented to investors to raise more money. Sounds familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it? But YC improves on that significantly. Julian knew a lot about law and business, but his advice ended there; he was not a startup guy. So we made some basic mistakes early on. And when we presented to investors, we presented to only 2, because that was all we knew. If we&rsquo;d had our later selves to encourage and advise us, and Demo Day to present at, we would have been in much better shape. We probably could have raised money at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did.If we take 7% of a company we fund, the founders only have to do 7.5% better in their next round of funding to end up net ahead. We certainly manage that.So who is our 7% coming out of? If the founders end up net ahead it&rsquo;s not coming out of them. So is it coming out of later stage investors? Well, they do end up paying more. But I think they pay more because the company is actually more valuable. And later stage investors have no problem with that. The returns of a VC fund depend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how cheaply they can buy stock in them.If what we do is useful, why wasn&rsquo;t anyone doing it before? There are two answers to that. One is that people were doing it before, just haphazardly on a smaller scale. Before us, seed funding came primarily from individual angel investors. Larry and Sergey, for example, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the founders of Sun. And because he was a startup guy he probably gave them useful advice. But raising money from angel investors is a hit or miss thing. It&rsquo;s a sideline for most of them, so they only do a handful of deals a year and they don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time on the startups they invest in. And they&rsquo;re hard to reach, because they don&rsquo;t want random startups pestering them with business plans. The Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew Bechtolsheim. It generally takes a personal introduction with angels.The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till recently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup. You&rsquo;ll notice we haven&rsquo;t funded any biotech startups. That&rsquo;s still expensive. But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap that you really can get a company airborne for $15,000. If you understand how to operate a steam catapult, at least.So in effect what&rsquo;s happened is that a new ecological niche has opened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved into it. We&rsquo;re not a replacement for venture capital funds. We occupy a new, adjacent niche. And conditions in our niche are really quite different. It&rsquo;s not just that the problems we face are different; the whole structure of the business is different. VCs are playing a zero-sum game. They&rsquo;re all competing for a slice of a fixed amount of &ldquo;deal flow,&rdquo; and that explains a lot of their behavior. Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraging hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups instead. We compete more with employers than VCs.It&rsquo;s not surprising something like this would happen. Most fields become more specialized—more articulated—as they develop, and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot of development over the past couple decades. The venture business in its present form is only about forty years old. It stands to reason it would evolve.And it&rsquo;s natural that the new niche would at first be described, even by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one. But really Y Combinator is not in the startup funding business. Really we&rsquo;re more of a small, furry steam catapult.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. Comment on this essay.</p>
