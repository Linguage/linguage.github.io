		<h1 id="smart">Smart</h1>
<p>Beyond Smart October 2021If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first. Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But that wasn&rsquo;t what was special about Einstein. What was special about him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not identical.It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence and its consequences are not identical, but it isn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a big gap between them. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent time around universities and research labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart people who don&rsquo;t achieve very much.I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired. Perhaps you did too. But I bet it&rsquo;s not what you really want. Imagine you had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing new, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely you&rsquo;d take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable, but when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that, it&rsquo;s obvious which is better.The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart still feels like the thing that matters, even though I know intellectually that it isn&rsquo;t. I spent so many years thinking it was. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering this illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value of new ideas, and you&rsquo;re constantly being judged by it. Whereas even the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren&rsquo;t usually discovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is the only game in town.There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood. Intelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis of the dominance hierarchy. [1] Plus having new ideas is such a new thing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society hasn&rsquo;t yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination, and intelligence merely a means to an end. [2]Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewed from that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one. But there&rsquo;s another way to look at it that&rsquo;s not just more optimistic, but more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the only ingredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients? Are they things we could cultivate?Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it&rsquo;s mostly inborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especially considering that most of us don&rsquo;t want it to be true, and the evidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I&rsquo;m not going to get into that question here, because it&rsquo;s the other ingredients in new ideas that I care about, and it&rsquo;s clear that many of them can be cultivated.That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got as a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn, the natural consequence is a sort of Brave New World fatalism. The best you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an &ldquo;aptitude&rdquo; for, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least be put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it. Whereas if intelligence isn&rsquo;t what matters, but only one of several ingredients in what does, and many of those aren&rsquo;t inborn, things get more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem of how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The fact that I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier — that society hasn&rsquo;t assimilated the fact that it&rsquo;s this and not intelligence that matters. Otherwise we&rsquo;d all know the answers to such a fundamental question. [3]I&rsquo;m not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the other ingredients here. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve posed the question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while to answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important: an obsessive interest in a particular topic. And this can definitely be cultivated.Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas is independent-mindedness. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to claim that this is distinct from intelligence — I&rsquo;d be reluctant to call someone smart who wasn&rsquo;t independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this quality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent.There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example, for working on your own projects and for overcoming the obstacles you face with early work — and these can all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. And there are also collections of techniques for generating specific types of new ideas, like startup ideas and essay topics.And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in discovering new ideas, like working hard, getting enough sleep, avoiding certain kinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks for working on what you want even when it&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re supposed to be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great work has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredients is not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new ideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it&rsquo;s not youth per se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with youth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigating this might lead to strategies that will help people of any age to have better ideas.One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing ability. There&rsquo;s a class of new ideas that are best discovered by writing essays and books. And that &ldquo;by&rdquo; is deliberate: you don&rsquo;t think of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. There is a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you&rsquo;re clumsy at writing, or don&rsquo;t enjoy doing it, that will get in your way if you try to do this kind of thinking. [4]I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn out to be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measure of unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try to hurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question, and start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas that it implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries about discovery. Notes[1] What wins in conversation depends on who with. It ranges from mere aggressiveness at the bottom, through quick-wittedness in the middle, to something closer to actual intelligence at the top, though probably always with some component of quick-wittedness.[2] Just as intelligence isn&rsquo;t the only ingredient in having new ideas, having new ideas isn&rsquo;t the only thing intelligence is useful for. It&rsquo;s also useful, for example, in diagnosing problems and figuring out how to fix them. Both overlap with having new ideas, but both have an end that doesn&rsquo;t.Those ways of using intelligence are much more common than having new ideas. And in such cases intelligence is even harder to distinguish from its consequences.[3] Some would attribute the difference between intelligence and having new ideas to &ldquo;creativity,&rdquo; but this doesn&rsquo;t seem a very useful term. As well as being pretty vague, it&rsquo;s shifted half a frame sideways from what we care about: it&rsquo;s neither separable from intelligence, nor responsible for all the difference between intelligence and having new ideas.[4] Curiously enough, this essay is an example. It started out as an essay about writing ability. But when I came to the distinction between intelligence and having new ideas, that seemed so much more important that I turned the original essay inside out, making that the topic and my original topic one of the points in it. As in many other fields, that level of reworking is easier to contemplate once you&rsquo;ve had a lot of practice.

		<h1 id="softwarepatents">Softwarepatents</h1>
<p>Are Software Patents Evil? March 2006(This essay is derived from a talk at Google.)A few weeks ago I found to my surprise that I&rsquo;d been granted four patents. This was all the more surprising because I&rsquo;d only applied for three. The patents aren&rsquo;t mine, of course. They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo&rsquo;s when they bought us. But the news set me thinking about the question of software patents generally.Patents are a hard problem. I&rsquo;ve had to advise most of the startups we&rsquo;ve funded about them, and despite years of experience I&rsquo;m still not always sure I&rsquo;m giving the right advice.One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you&rsquo;re against software patents, you&rsquo;re against patents in general. Gradually our machines consist more and more of software. Things that used to be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and trees and closures. There&rsquo;s nothing special about physical embodiments of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software equivalent not.Unfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point. Patent law in most countries says that algorithms aren&rsquo;t patentable. This rule is left over from a time when &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; meant something like the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In 1800, people could not see as readily as we can that a great many patents on mechanical objects were really patents on the algorithms they embodied.Patent lawyers still have to pretend that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing when they patent algorithms. You must not use the word &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; in the title of a patent application, just as you must not use the word &ldquo;essays&rdquo; in the title of a book. If you want to patent an algorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm. Then it&rsquo;s mechanical; phew. The default euphemism for algorithm is &ldquo;system and method.&rdquo; Try a patent search for that phrase and see how many results you get.Since software patents are no different from hardware patents, people who say &ldquo;software patents are evil&rdquo; are saying simply &ldquo;patents are evil.&rdquo; So why do so many people complain about software patents specifically?I think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept of software patents. Whenever software meets government, bad things happen, because software changes fast and government changes slow. The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and the novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes.The most common is to grant patents that shouldn&rsquo;t be granted. To be patentable, an invention has to be more than new. It also has to be non-obvious. And this, especially, is where the USPTO has been dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses the problem vividly: a knife and fork with the words &ldquo;patent pending&rdquo; superimposed.The scary thing is, this is the only icon they have for patent stories. Slashdot readers now take it for granted that a story about a patent will be about a bogus patent. That&rsquo;s how bad the problem has become.The problem with Amazon&rsquo;s notorious one-click patent, for example, is not that it&rsquo;s a software patent, but that it&rsquo;s obvious. Any online store that kept people&rsquo;s shipping addresses would have implemented this. The reason Amazon did it first was not that they were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they could buy something. [1]We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives and forks of our world. The problem is, the USPTO are not hackers. They&rsquo;re probably good at judging new inventions for casting steel or grinding lenses, but they don&rsquo;t understand software yet.At this point an optimist would be tempted to add &ldquo;but they will eventually.&rdquo; Unfortunately that might not be true. The problem with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the patent office takes a while to understand new technology. If so, this problem will only get worse, because the rate of technological change seems to be increasing. In thirty years, the patent office may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but there will be other new types of inventions they understand even less.Applying for a patent is a negotiation. You generally apply for a broader patent than you think you&rsquo;ll be granted, and the examiners reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting others. So I don&rsquo;t really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent. The big mistake was the patent office&rsquo;s, for not insisting on something narrower, with real technical content. By granting such an over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on the first date. Was Amazon supposed to say no?Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the patent, but in enforcing it. A lot of companies (Microsoft, for example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broad patents, but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes. Like nuclear weapons, the main role of big companies&rsquo; patent portfolios is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit. Amazon&rsquo;s suit against Barnes &amp; Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear first strike.That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them. Barnes &amp; Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway. To attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting black mark on their own reputation. Even now I think if you asked hackers to free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up in the first ten topics.Google clearly doesn&rsquo;t feel that merely holding patents is evil. They&rsquo;ve applied for a lot of them. Are they hypocrites? Are patents evil?There are really two variants of that question, and people answering it often aren&rsquo;t clear in their own minds which they&rsquo;re answering. There&rsquo;s a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal system, to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that the current legal system allows patents?These are separate questions. For example, in preindustrial societies like medieval Europe, when someone attacked you, you didn&rsquo;t call the police. There were no police. When attacked, you were supposed to fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it. Was this wrong? That&rsquo;s two questions: was it wrong to take justice into your own hands, and was it wrong that you had to? We tend to say yes to the second, but no to the first. If no one else will defend you, you have to defend yourself. [2]The situation with patents is similar. Business is a kind of ritualized warfare. Indeed, it evolved from actual warfare: most early traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates depending on how strong you seemed. In business there are certain rules describing how companies may and may not compete with one another, and someone deciding that they&rsquo;re going to play by their own rules is missing the point. Saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to apply for patents just because everyone else does&rdquo; is not like saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to lie just because everyone else does.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s more like saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to use TCP/IP just because everyone else does.&rdquo; Oh yes you are.A closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for the first time, realizing with shock that the players were deliberately bumping into one another, and deciding that one would on no account be so rude when playing hockey oneself.Hockey allows checking. It&rsquo;s part of the game. If your team refuses to do it, you simply lose. So it is in business. Under the present rules, patents are part of the game.What does that mean in practice? We tell the startups we fund not to worry about infringing patents, because startups rarely get sued for patent infringement. There are only two reasons someone might sue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them. Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money. And in practice they don&rsquo;t seem to get sued much by competitors, either. They don&rsquo;t get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensive distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they are, their patents probably haven&rsquo;t issued yet. [3] Nor do startups, at least in the software business, seem to get sued much by established competitors. Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don&rsquo;t know of an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don&rsquo;t win by winning lawsuits. That&rsquo;s too uncertain. They win by locking competitors out of their sales channels. If you do manage to threaten them, they&rsquo;re more likely to buy you than sue you.When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller ones, it&rsquo;s usually a big company on the way down, grasping at straws. For example, Unisys&rsquo;s attempts to enforce their patent on LZW compression. When you see a big company threatening patent suits, sell. When a company starts fighting over IP, it&rsquo;s a sign they&rsquo;ve lost the real battle, for users.A company that sues competitors for patent infringement is like a defender who has been beaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead with the referee. You don&rsquo;t do that if you can still reach the ball, even if you genuinely believe you&rsquo;ve been fouled. So a company threatening patent suits is a company in trouble.When we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commerce business was granted a patent on online ordering, or something like that. I got a call from a VP there asking if we&rsquo;d like to license it. I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, and would never hold up in court. &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;So, are you guys hiring?&ldquo;If your startup grows big enough, however, you&rsquo;ll start to get sued, no matter what you do. If you go public, for example, you&rsquo;ll be sued by multiple patent trolls who hope you&rsquo;ll pay them off to go away. More on them later.In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not. So I advise fatalism. Don&rsquo;t waste your time worrying about patent infringement. You&rsquo;re probably violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces. At the start, at least, just worry about making something great and getting lots of users. If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth attacking, you&rsquo;re doing well.We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors. Successful startups either get bought or grow into big companies. If a startup wants to grow into a big company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent portfolio they&rsquo;ll need to maintain an armed truce with other big companies. If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirers care about patents. Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy decision for the acquirer. Should we buy this little startup or build our own? And two things, especially, make them decide not to build their own: if you already have a large and rapidly growing user base, and if you have a fairly solid patent application on critical parts of your software.There&rsquo;s a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building: that if they built their own, they&rsquo;d screw it up. But few big companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves. It&rsquo;s usually the acquirer&rsquo;s engineers who are asked how hard it would be for the company to build their own, and they overestimate their abilities. [4] A patent seems to change the balance. It gives the acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn&rsquo;t copy what you&rsquo;re doing. It may also help them to grasp what&rsquo;s special about your technology.Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the software business. It&rsquo;s kind of ironic, considering all the dire things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but when one looks closely at the software business, the most striking thing is how little patents seem to matter.In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent infringement. For example, the airport baggage scanning business was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies, InVision and L-3. In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with new technology that let them build scanners a third the size. They were sued for patent infringement before they&rsquo;d even released a product.You rarely hear that kind of story in our world. The one example I&rsquo;ve found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patent suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005. Xfire doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a very big deal, and it&rsquo;s hard to say why Yahoo felt threatened. Xfire&rsquo;s VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar stuff&ndash; in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo sued over&ndash; so perhaps there was something personal about it. My guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed. At any rate they didn&rsquo;t pursue the suit very vigorously.Why do patents play so small a role in software? I can think of three possible reasons.One is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves are not worth very much. I may be maligning other fields here, but it seems that in most types of engineering you can hand the details of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and get the desired result. For example, if someone develops a new process for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they&rsquo;ll be able to get the same yield. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to work in software. Software is so subtle and unpredictable that &ldquo;qualified experts&rdquo; don&rsquo;t get you very far.That&rsquo;s why we rarely hear phrases like &ldquo;qualified expert&rdquo; in the software business. What that level of ability can get you is, say, to make your software compatible with some other piece of software&ndash; in eight months, at enormous cost. To do anything harder you need individual brilliance. If you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them to make a new web-based email program, they&rsquo;ll get their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds.Experts can implement, but they can&rsquo;t design. Or rather, expertise in implementation is the only kind most people, including the experts themselves, can measure. [5]But design is a definite skill. It&rsquo;s not just an airy intangible. Things always seem intangible when you don&rsquo;t understand them. Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800. Who knew there was so much to know about it? So it is with design. Some people are good at it and some people are bad at it, and there&rsquo;s something very tangible they&rsquo;re good or bad at.The reason design counts so much in software is probably that there are fewer constraints than on physical things. Building physical things is expensive and dangerous. The space of possible choices is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; and you&rsquo;re subject to a lot of regulations. You don&rsquo;t have any of that if you and a couple friends decide to create a new web-based application.Because there&rsquo;s so much scope for design in software, a successful application tends to be way more than the sum of its patents. What protects little companies from being copied by bigger competitors is not just their patents, but the thousand little things the big company will get wrong if they try.The second reason patents don&rsquo;t count for much in our world is that startups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did. In the software business, startups beat established companies by transcending them. Startups don&rsquo;t build desktop word processing programs to compete with Microsoft Word. [6] They build Writely. If this paradigm is crowded, just wait for the next one; they run pretty frequently on this route.Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial. If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they&rsquo;ll meet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot. To sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often means seeing something the big company doesn&rsquo;t want to see. IBM used to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn&rsquo;t bother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn&rsquo;t want to see the threat it posed. Companies building web based apps are similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn&rsquo;t want to imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant.The third reason patents don&rsquo;t seem to matter very much in software is public opinion&ndash; or rather, hacker opinion. In a recent interview, Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of attacking Linux on patent grounds. But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid. They&rsquo;d face the mother of all boycotts. And not just from the technical community in general; a lot of their own people would rebel.Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are highly mobile. If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won&rsquo;t work there. For some reason this seems to be more true in software than other businesses. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because hackers have intrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills are easily transferrable. Perhaps we can split the difference and say that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled.Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; policy may for this reason be the most valuable thing they&rsquo;ve discovered. It&rsquo;s very constraining in some ways. If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whacked for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy. But I think it&rsquo;s worth it. It helps them to hire the best people, and it&rsquo;s better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to be constrained by principles than by stupidity.(I wish someone would get this point across to the present administration.)I&rsquo;m not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three ingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be not to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and too poor to sue one another. So despite the huge number of software patents there&rsquo;s not a lot of suing going on. With one exception: patent trolls.Patent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose whole business is to accumulate patents and threaten to sue companies who actually make things. Patent trolls, it seems safe to say, are evil. I feel a bit stupid saying that, because when you&rsquo;re saying something that Richard Stallman and Bill Gates would both agree with, you must be perilously close to tautologies.The CEO of Forgent, one of the most notorious patent trolls, says that what his company does is &ldquo;the American way.&rdquo; Actually that&rsquo;s not true. The American way is to make money by creating wealth, not by suing people. [7] What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrial way. In the period just before the industrial revolution, some of the greatest fortunes in countries like England and France were made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crown&ndash; like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk&ndash; and then used this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business. So when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they&rsquo;re more right than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad specifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model.Patent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise. In the last couple years they&rsquo;ve extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from them. Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely because they create nothing. Big companies are safe from being sued by other big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit. But because patent trolls don&rsquo;t make anything, there&rsquo;s nothing they can be sued for. I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly, at least by legal standards. It&rsquo;s clearly an abuse of the system, and the victims are powerful. [8]But evil as patent trolls are, I don&rsquo;t think they hamper innovation much. They don&rsquo;t sue till a startup has made money, and by that point the innovation that generated it has already happened. I can&rsquo;t think of a startup that avoided working on some problem because of patent trolls.So much for hockey as the game is played now. What about the more theoretical question of whether hockey would be a better game without checking? Do patents encourage or discourage innovation?This is a very hard question to answer in the general case. People write whole books on the topic. One of my main hobbies is the history of technology, and even though I&rsquo;ve studied the subject for years, it would take me several weeks of research to be able to say whether patents have in general been a net win.One thing I can say is that 99.9% of the people who express opinions on the subject do it not based on such research, but out of a kind of religious conviction. At least, that&rsquo;s the polite way of putting it; the colloquial version involves speech coming out of organs not designed for that purpose.Whether they encourage innovation or not, patents were at least intended to. You don&rsquo;t get a patent for nothing. In return for the exclusive right to use an idea, you have to publish it, and it was largely to encourage such openness that patents were established.Before patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret. With patents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyone your idea, we&rsquo;ll protect it for you. There is a parallel here to the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time. Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order, rich people had private armies. As governments got more powerful, they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility for protecting them. (Magnates still have bodyguards, but no longer to protect them from other magnates.)Patents, like police, are involved in many abuses. But in both cases the default is something worse. The choice is not &ldquo;patents or freedom?&rdquo; any more than it is &ldquo;police or freedom?&rdquo; The actual questions are respectively &ldquo;patents or secrecy?&rdquo; and &ldquo;police or gangs?&ldquo;As with gangs, we have some idea what secrecy would be like, because that&rsquo;s how things used to be. The economy of medieval Europe was divided up into little tribes, each jealously guarding their privileges and secrets. In Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; was synonymous with &ldquo;craft.&rdquo; Even today we can see an echo of the secrecy of medieval guilds, in the now pointless secrecy of the Masons.The most memorable example of medieval industrial secrecy is probably Venice, which forbade glassblowers to leave the city, and sent assassins after those who tried. We might like to think we wouldn&rsquo;t go so far, but the movie industry has already tried to pass laws prescribing three year prison terms just for putting movies on public networks. Want to try a frightening thought experiment? If the movie industry could have any law they wanted, where would they stop? Short of the death penalty, one assumes, but how close would they get?Even worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decrease in efficiency that would accompany increased secrecy. As anyone who has dealt with organizations that operate on a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells is terribly inefficient. The flaw in the &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; principle is that you don&rsquo;t know who needs to know something. An idea from one area might spark a great discovery in another. But the discoverer doesn&rsquo;t know he needs to know it.If secrecy were the only protection for ideas, companies wouldn&rsquo;t just have to be secretive with other companies; they&rsquo;d have to be secretive internally. This would encourage what is already the worst trait of big companies.I&rsquo;m not saying secrecy would be worse than patents, just that we couldn&rsquo;t discard patents for free. Businesses would become more secretive to compensate, and in some fields this might get ugly. Nor am I defending the current patent system. There is clearly a lot that&rsquo;s broken about it. But the breakage seems to affect software less than most other fields.In the software business I know from experience whether patents encourage or discourage innovation, and the answer is the type that people who like to argue about public policy least like to hear: they don&rsquo;t affect innovation much, one way or the other. Most innovation in the software business happens in startups, and startups should simply ignore other companies&rsquo; patents. At least, that&rsquo;s what we advise, and we bet money on that advice.The only real role of patents, for most startups, is as an element of the mating dance with acquirers. There patents do help a little. And so they do encourage innovation indirectly, in that they give more power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the most innovation happens. But even in the mating dance, patents are of secondary importance. It matters more to make something great and get a lot of users.Notes[1] You have to be careful here, because a great discovery often seems obvious in retrospect. One-click ordering, however, is not such a discovery.[2] &ldquo;Turn the other cheek&rdquo; skirts the issue; the critical question is not how to deal with slaps, but sword thrusts.[3] Applying for a patent is now very slow, but it might actually be bad if that got fixed. At the moment the time it takes to get a patent is conveniently just longer than the time it takes a startup to succeed or fail.[4] Instead of the canonical &ldquo;could you build this?&rdquo; maybe the corp dev guys should be asking &ldquo;will you build this?&rdquo; or even &ldquo;why haven&rsquo;t you already built this?&quot;[5] Design ability is so hard to measure that you can&rsquo;t even trust the design world&rsquo;s internal standards. You can&rsquo;t assume that someone with a degree in design is any good at design, or that an eminent designer is any better than his peers. If that worked, any company could build products as good as Apple&rsquo;s just by hiring sufficiently qualified designers.[6] If anyone wanted to try, we&rsquo;d be interested to hear from them. I suspect it&rsquo;s one of those things that&rsquo;s not as hard as everyone assumes.[7] Patent trolls can&rsquo;t even claim, like speculators, that they &ldquo;create&rdquo; liquidity.[8] If big companies don&rsquo;t want to wait for the government to take action, there is a way to fight back themselves. For a long time I thought there wasn&rsquo;t, because there was nothing to grab onto. But there is one resource patent trolls need: lawyers. Big technology companies between them generate a lot of legal business. If they agreed among themselves never to do business with any firm employing anyone who had worked for a patent troll, either as an employee or as outside counsel, they could probably starve the trolls of the lawyers they need.Thanks to Dan Bloomberg, Paul Buchheit, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, and Peter Norvig for reading drafts of this, to Joel Lehrer and Peter Eng for answering my questions about patents, and to Ankur Pansari for inviting me to speak.Japanese Translation</p>

<p>A Plan for Spam Like to build things? Try Hacker News. August 2002(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques used in the spamproof web-based mail reader we built to exercise Arc. An improved algorithm is described in Better Bayesian Filtering.)I think it&rsquo;s possible to stop spam, and that content-based filters are the way to do it. The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message. They can circumvent any other barrier you set up. They have so far, at least. But they have to deliver their message, whatever it is. If we can write software that recognizes their messages, there is no way they can get around that._ _ <em>To the recipient, spam is easily recognizable. If you hired someone to read your mail and discard the spam, they would have little trouble doing it. How much do we have to do, short of AI, to automate this process?I think we will be able to solve the problem with fairly simple algorithms. In fact, I&rsquo;ve found that you can filter present-day spam acceptably well using nothing more than a Bayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individual words. Using a slightly tweaked (as described below) Bayesian filter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false positives.The statistical approach is not usually the first one people try when they write spam filters. Most hackers&rsquo; first instinct is to try to write software that recognizes individual properties of spam. You look at spams and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail that begins &ldquo;Dear Friend&rdquo; or has a subject line that&rsquo;s all uppercase and ends in eight exclamation points. I can filter out that stuff with about one line of code.And so you do, and in the beginning it works. A few simple rules will take a big bite out of your incoming spam. Merely looking for the word &ldquo;click&rdquo; will catch 79.7% of the emails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives.I spent about six months writing software that looked for individual spam features before I tried the statistical approach. What I found was that recognizing that last few percent of spams got very hard, and that as I made the filters stricter I got more false positives.False positives are innocent emails that get mistakenly identified as spams. For most users, missing legitimate email is an order of magnitude worse than receiving spam, so a filter that yields false positives is like an acne cure that carries a risk of death to the patient.The more spam a user gets, the less likely he&rsquo;ll be to notice one innocent mail sitting in his spam folder. And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get, the more dangerous false positives become, because when the filters are really good, users will be more likely to ignore everything they catch.I don&rsquo;t know why I avoided trying the statistical approach for so long. I think it was because I got addicted to trying to identify spam features myself, as if I were playing some kind of competitive game with the spammers. (Nonhackers don&rsquo;t often realize this, but most hackers are very competitive.) When I did try statistical analysis, I found immediately that it was much cleverer than I had been. It discovered, of course, that terms like &ldquo;virtumundo&rdquo; and &ldquo;teens&rdquo; were good indicators of spam. But it also discovered that &ldquo;per&rdquo; and &ldquo;FL&rdquo; and &ldquo;ff0000&rdquo; are good indicators of spam. In fact, &ldquo;ff0000&rdquo; (html for bright red) turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any pornographic term.</em> _ <em>Here&rsquo;s a sketch of how I do statistical filtering. I start with one corpus of spam and one of nonspam mail. At the moment each one has about 4000 messages in it. I scan the entire text, including headers and embedded html and javascript, of each message in each corpus. I currently consider alphanumeric characters, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of tokens, and everything else to be a token separator. (There is probably room for improvement here.) I ignore tokens that are all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not even considering them as token separators.I count the number of times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs in each corpus. At this stage I end up with two large hash tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to number of occurrences.Next I create a third hash table, this time mapping each token to the probability that an email containing it is a spam, which I calculate as follows [1]: (let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0))) (b (or (gethash word bad) 0))) (unless (&lt; (+ g b) 5) (max .01 (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad)) (+ (min 1 (/ g ngood)) (min 1 (/ b nbad))))))))) where word is the token whose probability we&rsquo;re calculating, good and bad are the hash tables I created in the first step, and ngood and nbad are the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively.I explained this as code to show a couple of important details. I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid false positives, and by trial and error I&rsquo;ve found that a good way to do it is to double all the numbers in good. This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally do occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. I only consider words that occur more than five times in total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three times in nonspam mail would be enough). And then there is the question of what probability to assign to words that occur in one corpus but not the other. Again by trial and error I chose .01 and .99. There may be room for tuning here, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happen automatically anyway.The especially observant will notice that while I consider each corpus to be a single long stream of text for purposes of counting occurrences, I use the number of emails in each, rather than their combined length, as the divisor in calculating spam probabilities. This adds another slight bias to protect against false positives.When new mail arrives, it is scanned into tokens, and the most interesting fifteen tokens, where interesting is measured by how far their spam probability is from a neutral .5, are used to calculate the probability that the mail is spam. If probs is a list of the fifteen individual probabilities, you calculate the combined probability thus: (let ((prod (apply #&rsquo;* probs))) (/ prod (+ prod (apply #&rsquo;* (mapcar #&rsquo;(lambda (x) (- 1 x)) probs))))) One question that arises in practice is what probability to assign to a word you&rsquo;ve never seen, i.e. one that doesn&rsquo;t occur in the hash table of word probabilities. I&rsquo;ve found, again by trial and error, that .4 is a good number to use. If you&rsquo;ve never seen a word before, it is probably fairly innocent; spam words tend to be all too familiar.There are examples of this algorithm being applied to actual emails in an appendix at the end.I treat mail as spam if the algorithm above gives it a probability of more than .9 of being spam. But in practice it would not matter much where I put this threshold, because few probabilities end up in the middle of the range.</em> _ <em>One great advantage of the statistical approach is that you don&rsquo;t have to read so many spams. Over the past six months, I&rsquo;ve read literally thousands of spams, and it is really kind of demoralizing. Norbert Wiener said if you compete with slaves you become a slave, and there is something similarly degrading about competing with spammers. To recognize individual spam features you have to try to get into the mind of the spammer, and frankly I want to spend as little time inside the minds of spammers as possible.But the real advantage of the Bayesian approach, of course, is that you know what you&rsquo;re measuring. Feature-recognizing filters like SpamAssassin assign a spam &ldquo;score&rdquo; to email. The Bayesian approach assigns an actual probability. The problem with a &ldquo;score&rdquo; is that no one knows what it means. The user doesn&rsquo;t know what it means, but worse still, neither does the developer of the filter. How many points should an email get for having the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; in it? A probability can of course be mistaken, but there is little ambiguity about what it means, or how evidence should be combined to calculate it. Based on my corpus, &ldquo;sex&rdquo; indicates a .97 probability of the containing email being a spam, whereas &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; indicates .99 probability. And Bayes&rsquo; Rule, equally unambiguous, says that an email containing both words would, in the (unlikely) absence of any other evidence, have a 99.97% chance of being a spam.Because it is measuring probabilities, the Bayesian approach considers all the evidence in the email, both good and bad. Words that occur disproportionately rarely in spam (like &ldquo;though&rdquo; or &ldquo;tonight&rdquo; or &ldquo;apparently&rdquo;) contribute as much to decreasing the probability as bad words like &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; and &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; do to increasing it. So an otherwise innocent email that happens to include the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; is not going to get tagged as spam.Ideally, of course, the probabilities should be calculated individually for each user. I get a lot of email containing the word &ldquo;Lisp&rdquo;, and (so far) no spam that does. So a word like that is effectively a kind of password for sending mail to me. In my earlier spam-filtering software, the user could set up a list of such words and mail containing them would automatically get past the filters. On my list I put words like &ldquo;Lisp&rdquo; and also my zipcode, so that (otherwise rather spammy-sounding) receipts from online orders would get through. I thought I was being very clever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did the same thing for me, and moreover discovered of a lot of words I hadn&rsquo;t thought of.When I said at the start that our filters let through less than 5 spams per 1000 with 0 false positives, I&rsquo;m talking about filtering my mail based on a corpus of my mail. But these numbers are not misleading, because that is the approach I&rsquo;m advocating: filter each user&rsquo;s mail based on the spam and nonspam mail he receives. Essentially, each user should have two delete buttons, ordinary delete and delete-as-spam. Anything deleted as spam goes into the spam corpus, and everything else goes into the nonspam corpus.You could start users with a seed filter, but ultimately each user should have his own per-word probabilities based on the actual mail he receives. This (a) makes the filters more effective, (b) lets each user decide their own precise definition of spam, and (c) perhaps best of all makes it hard for spammers to tune mails to get through the filters. If a lot of the brain of the filter is in the individual databases, then merely tuning spams to get through the seed filters won&rsquo;t guarantee anything about how well they&rsquo;ll get through individual users&rsquo; varying and much more trained filters.Content-based spam filtering is often combined with a whitelist, a list of senders whose mail can be accepted with no filtering. One easy way to build such a whitelist is to keep a list of every address the user has ever sent mail to. If a mail reader has a delete-as-spam button then you could also add the from address of every email the user has deleted as ordinary trash.I&rsquo;m an advocate of whitelists, but more as a way to save computation than as a way to improve filtering. I used to think that whitelists would make filtering easier, because you&rsquo;d only have to filter email from people you&rsquo;d never heard from, and someone sending you mail for the first time is constrained by convention in what they can say to you. Someone you already know might send you an email talking about sex, but someone sending you mail for the first time would not be likely to. The problem is, people can have more than one email address, so a new from-address doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that the sender is writing to you for the first time. It is not unusual for an old friend (especially if he is a hacker) to suddenly send you an email with a new from-address, so you can&rsquo;t risk false positives by filtering mail from unknown addresses especially stringently.In a sense, though, my filters do themselves embody a kind of whitelist (and blacklist) because they are based on entire messages, including the headers. So to that extent they &ldquo;know&rdquo; the email addresses of trusted senders and even the routes by which mail gets from them to me. And they know the same about spam, including the server names, mailer versions, and protocols.</em> _ <em>If I thought that I could keep up current rates of spam filtering, I would consider this problem solved. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean much to be able to filter out most present-day spam, because spam evolves. Indeed, most antispam techniques so far have been like pesticides that do nothing more than create a new, resistant strain of bugs.I&rsquo;m more hopeful about Bayesian filters, because they evolve with the spam. So as spammers start using &ldquo;c0ck&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;cock&rdquo; to evade simple-minded spam filters based on individual words, Bayesian filters automatically notice. Indeed, &ldquo;c0ck&rdquo; is far more damning evidence than &ldquo;cock&rdquo;, and Bayesian filters know precisely how much more.Still, anyone who proposes a plan for spam filtering has to be able to answer the question: if the spammers knew exactly what you were doing, how well could they get past you? For example, I think that if checksum-based spam filtering becomes a serious obstacle, the spammers will just switch to mad-lib techniques for generating message bodies.To beat Bayesian filters, it would not be enough for spammers to make their emails unique or to stop using individual naughty words. They&rsquo;d have to make their mails indistinguishable from your ordinary mail. And this I think would severely constrain them. Spam is mostly sales pitches, so unless your regular mail is all sales pitches, spams will inevitably have a different character. And the spammers would also, of course, have to change (and keep changing) their whole infrastructure, because otherwise the headers would look as bad to the Bayesian filters as ever, no matter what they did to the message body. I don&rsquo;t know enough about the infrastructure that spammers use to know how hard it would be to make the headers look innocent, but my guess is that it would be even harder than making the message look innocent.Assuming they could solve the problem of the headers, the spam of the future will probably look something like this: Hey there. Thought you should check out the following: <a href="http://www.27meg.com/foo">http://www.27meg.com/foo</a> because that is about as much sales pitch as content-based filtering will leave the spammer room to make. (Indeed, it will be hard even to get this past filters, because if everything else in the email is neutral, the spam probability will hinge on the url, and it will take some effort to make that look neutral.)Spammers range from businesses running so-called opt-in lists who don&rsquo;t even try to conceal their identities, to guys who hijack mail servers to send out spams promoting porn sites. If we use filtering to whittle their options down to mails like the one above, that should pretty much put the spammers on the &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; end of the spectrum out of business; they feel obliged by various state laws to include boilerplate about why their spam is not spam, and how to cancel your &ldquo;subscription,&rdquo; and that kind of text is easy to recognize.(I used to think it was naive to believe that stricter laws would decrease spam. Now I think that while stricter laws may not decrease the amount of spam that spammers send, they can certainly help filters to decrease the amount of spam that recipients actually see.)All along the spectrum, if you restrict the sales pitches spammers can make, you will inevitably tend to put them out of business. That word business is an important one to remember. The spammers are businessmen. They send spam because it works. It works because although the response rate is abominably low (at best 15 per million, vs 3000 per million for a catalog mailing), the cost, to them, is practically nothing. The cost is enormous for the recipients, about 5 man-weeks for each million recipients who spend a second to delete the spam, but the spammer doesn&rsquo;t have to pay that.Sending spam does cost the spammer something, though. [2] So the lower we can get the response rate&ndash; whether by filtering, or by using filters to force spammers to dilute their pitches&ndash; the fewer businesses will find it worth their while to send spam.The reason the spammers use the kinds of sales pitches that they do is to increase response rates. This is possibly even more disgusting than getting inside the mind of a spammer, but let&rsquo;s take a quick look inside the mind of someone who responds to a spam. This person is either astonishingly credulous or deeply in denial about their sexual interests. In either case, repulsive or idiotic as the spam seems to us, it is exciting to them. The spammers wouldn&rsquo;t say these things if they didn&rsquo;t sound exciting. And &ldquo;thought you should check out the following&rdquo; is just not going to have nearly the pull with the spam recipient as the kinds of things that spammers say now. Result: if it can&rsquo;t contain exciting sales pitches, spam becomes less effective as a marketing vehicle, and fewer businesses want to use it.That is the big win in the end. I started writing spam filtering software because I didn&rsquo;t want have to look at the stuff anymore. But if we get good enough at filtering out spam, it will stop working, and the spammers will actually stop sending it.</em> _ _Of all the approaches to fighting spam, from software to laws, I believe Bayesian filtering will be the single most effective. But I also think that the more different kinds of antispam efforts we undertake, the better, because any measure that constrains spammers will tend to make filtering easier. And even within the world of content-based filtering, I think it will be a good thing if there are many different kinds of software being used simultaneously. The more different filters there are, the harder it will be for spammers to tune spams to get through them. Appendix: Examples of FilteringHere is an example of a spam that arrived while I was writing this article. The fifteen most interesting words in this spam are: qvp0045 indira mx-05 intimail $7500 freeyankeedom cdo bluefoxmedia jpg unsecured platinum 3d0 qves 7c5 7c266675 The words are a mix of stuff from the headers and from the message body, which is typical of spam. Also typical of spam is that every one of these words has a spam probability, in my database, of .99. In fact there are more than fifteen words with probabilities of .99, and these are just the first fifteen seen.Unfortunately that makes this email a boring example of the use of Bayes&rsquo; Rule. To see an interesting variety of probabilities we have to look at this actually quite atypical spam.The fifteen most interesting words in this spam, with their probabilities, are: madam 0.99 promotion 0.99 republic 0.99 shortest 0.047225013 mandatory 0.047225013 standardization 0.07347802 sorry 0.08221981 supported 0.09019077 people&rsquo;s 0.09019077 enter 0.9075001 quality 0.8921298 organization 0.12454646 investment 0.8568143 very 0.14758544 valuable 0.82347786 This time the evidence is a mix of good and bad. A word like &ldquo;shortest&rdquo; is almost as much evidence for innocence as a word like &ldquo;madam&rdquo; or &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; is for guilt. But still the case for guilt is stronger. If you combine these numbers according to Bayes&rsquo; Rule, the resulting probability is .9027.&ldquo;Madam&rdquo; is obviously from spams beginning &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re not very common, but the word &ldquo;madam&rdquo; never occurs in my legitimate email, and it&rsquo;s all about the ratio.&ldquo;Republic&rdquo; scores high because it often shows up in Nigerian scam emails, and also occurs once or twice in spams referring to Korea and South Africa. You might say that it&rsquo;s an accident that it thus helps identify this spam. But I&rsquo;ve found when examining spam probabilities that there are a lot of these accidents, and they have an uncanny tendency to push things in the right direction rather than the wrong one. In this case, it is not entirely a coincidence that the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; occurs in Nigerian scam emails and this spam. There is a whole class of dubious business propositions involving less developed countries, and these in turn are more likely to have names that specify explicitly (because they aren&rsquo;t) that they are republics.[3]On the other hand, &ldquo;enter&rdquo; is a genuine miss. It occurs mostly in unsubscribe instructions, but here is used in a completely innocent way. Fortunately the statistical approach is fairly robust, and can tolerate quite a lot of misses before the results start to be thrown off.For comparison, here is an example of that rare bird, a spam that gets through the filters. Why? Because by sheer chance it happens to be loaded with words that occur in my actual email: perl 0.01 python 0.01 tcl 0.01 scripting 0.01 morris 0.01 graham 0.01491078 guarantee 0.9762507 cgi 0.9734398 paul 0.027040077 quite 0.030676773 pop3 0.042199217 various 0.06080265 prices 0.9359873 managed 0.06451222 difficult 0.071706355 There are a couple pieces of good news here. First, this mail probably wouldn&rsquo;t get through the filters of someone who didn&rsquo;t happen to specialize in programming languages and have a good friend called Morris. For the average user, all the top five words here would be neutral and would not contribute to the spam probability.Second, I think filtering based on word pairs (see below) might well catch this one: &ldquo;cost effective&rdquo;, &ldquo;setup fee&rdquo;, &ldquo;money back&rdquo; &ndash; pretty incriminating stuff. And of course if they continued to spam me (or a network I was part of), &ldquo;Hostex&rdquo; itself would be recognized as a spam term.Finally, here is an innocent email. Its fifteen most interesting words are as follows: continuation 0.01 describe 0.01 continuations 0.01 example 0.033600237 programming 0.05214485 i&rsquo;m 0.055427782 examples 0.07972858 color 0.9189189 localhost 0.09883721 hi 0.116539136 california 0.84421706 same 0.15981844 spot 0.1654587 us-ascii 0.16804294 what 0.19212411 Most of the words here indicate the mail is an innocent one. There are two bad smelling words, &ldquo;color&rdquo; (spammers love colored fonts) and &ldquo;California&rdquo; (which occurs in testimonials and also in menus in forms), but they are not enough to outweigh obviously innocent words like &ldquo;continuation&rdquo; and &ldquo;example&rdquo;.It&rsquo;s interesting that &ldquo;describe&rdquo; rates as so thoroughly innocent. It hasn&rsquo;t occurred in a single one of my 4000 spams. The data turns out to be full of such surprises. One of the things you learn when you analyze spam texts is how narrow a subset of the language spammers operate in. It&rsquo;s that fact, together with the equally characteristic vocabulary of any individual user&rsquo;s mail, that makes Bayesian filtering a good bet.Appendix: More IdeasOne idea that I haven&rsquo;t tried yet is to filter based on word pairs, or even triples, rather than individual words. This should yield a much sharper estimate of the probability. For example, in my current database, the word &ldquo;offers&rdquo; has a probability of .96. If you based the probabilities on word pairs, you&rsquo;d end up with &ldquo;special offers&rdquo; and &ldquo;valuable offers&rdquo; having probabilities of .99 and, say, &ldquo;approach offers&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;this approach offers&rdquo;) having a probability of .1 or less.The reason I haven&rsquo;t done this is that filtering based on individual words already works so well. But it does mean that there is room to tighten the filters if spam gets harder to detect. (Curiously, a filter based on word pairs would be in effect a Markov-chaining text generator running in reverse.)Specific spam features (e.g. not seeing the recipient&rsquo;s address in the to: field) do of course have value in recognizing spam. They can be considered in this algorithm by treating them as virtual words. I&rsquo;ll probably do this in future versions, at least for a handful of the most egregious spam indicators. Feature-recognizing spam filters are right in many details; what they lack is an overall discipline for combining evidence.Recognizing nonspam features may be more important than recognizing spam features. False positives are such a worry that they demand extraordinary measures. I will probably in future versions add a second level of testing designed specifically to avoid false positives. If a mail triggers this second level of filters it will be accepted even if its spam probability is above the threshold.I don&rsquo;t expect this second level of filtering to be Bayesian. It will inevitably be not only ad hoc, but based on guesses, because the number of false positives will not tend to be large enough to notice patterns. (It is just as well, anyway, if a backup system doesn&rsquo;t rely on the same technology as the primary system.)Another thing I may try in the future is to focus extra attention on specific parts of the email. For example, about 95% of current spam includes the url of a site they want you to visit. (The remaining 5% want you to call a phone number, reply by email or to a US mail address, or in a few cases to buy a certain stock.) The url is in such cases practically enough by itself to determine whether the email is spam.Domain names differ from the rest of the text in a (non-German) email in that they often consist of several words stuck together. Though computationally expensive in the general case, it might be worth trying to decompose them. If a filter has never seen the token &ldquo;xxxporn&rdquo; before it will have an individual spam probability of .4, whereas &ldquo;xxx&rdquo; and &ldquo;porn&rdquo; individually have probabilities (in my corpus) of .9889 and .99 respectively, and a combined probability of .9998.I expect decomposing domain names to become more important as spammers are gradually forced to stop using incriminating words in the text of their messages. (A url with an ip address is of course an extremely incriminating sign, except in the mail of a few sysadmins.)It might be a good idea to have a cooperatively maintained list of urls promoted by spammers. We&rsquo;d need a trust metric of the type studied by Raph Levien to prevent malicious or incompetent submissions, but if we had such a thing it would provide a boost to any filtering software. It would also be a convenient basis for boycotts.Another way to test dubious urls would be to send out a crawler to look at the site before the user looked at the email mentioning it. You could use a Bayesian filter to rate the site just as you would an email, and whatever was found on the site could be included in calculating the probability of the email being a spam. A url that led to a redirect would of course be especially suspicious.One cooperative project that I think really would be a good idea would be to accumulate a giant corpus of spam. A large, clean corpus is the key to making Bayesian filtering work well. Bayesian filters could actually use the corpus as input. But such a corpus would be useful for other kinds of filters too, because it could be used to test them.Creating such a corpus poses some technical problems. We&rsquo;d need trust metrics to prevent malicious or incompetent submissions, of course. We&rsquo;d also need ways of erasing personal information (not just to-addresses and ccs, but also e.g. the arguments to unsubscribe urls, which often encode the to-address) from mails in the corpus. If anyone wants to take on this project, it would be a good thing for the world.Appendix: Defining SpamI think there is a rough consensus on what spam is, but it would be useful to have an explicit definition. We&rsquo;ll need to do this if we want to establish a central corpus of spam, or even to compare spam filtering rates meaningfully.To start with, spam is not unsolicited commercial email. If someone in my neighborhood heard that I was looking for an old Raleigh three-speed in good condition, and sent me an email offering to sell me one, I&rsquo;d be delighted, and yet this email would be both commercial and unsolicited. The defining feature of spam (in fact, its raison d&rsquo;etre) is not that it is unsolicited, but that it is automated.It is merely incidental, too, that spam is usually commercial. If someone started sending mass email to support some political cause, for example, it would be just as much spam as email promoting a porn site.I propose we define spam as unsolicited automated email. This definition thus includes some email that many legal definitions of spam don&rsquo;t. Legal definitions of spam, influenced presumably by lobbyists, tend to exclude mail sent by companies that have an &ldquo;existing relationship&rdquo; with the recipient. But buying something from a company, for example, does not imply that you have solicited ongoing email from them. If I order something from an online store, and they then send me a stream of spam, it&rsquo;s still spam.Companies sending spam often give you a way to &ldquo;unsubscribe,&rdquo; or ask you to go to their site and change your &ldquo;account preferences&rdquo; if you want to stop getting spam. This is not enough to stop the mail from being spam. Not opting out is not the same as opting in. Unless the recipient explicitly checked a clearly labelled box (whose default was no) asking to receive the email, then it is spam.In some business relationships, you do implicitly solicit certain kinds of mail. When you order online, I think you implicitly solicit a receipt, and notification when the order ships. I don&rsquo;t mind when Verisign sends me mail warning that a domain name is about to expire (at least, if they are the actual registrar for it). But when Verisign sends me email offering a FREE Guide to Building My E-Commerce Web Site, that&rsquo;s spam. Notes:[1] The examples in this article are translated into Common Lisp for, believe it or not, greater accessibility. The application described here is one that we wrote in order to test a new Lisp dialect called Arc that is not yet released.[2] Currently the lowest rate seems to be about $200 to send a million spams. That&rsquo;s very cheap, 1/50th of a cent per spam. But filtering out 95% of spam, for example, would increase the spammers&rsquo; cost to reach a given audience by a factor of 20. Few can have margins big enough to absorb that.[3] As a rule of thumb, the more qualifiers there are before the name of a country, the more corrupt the rulers. A country called The Socialist People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic of X is probably the last place in the world you&rsquo;d want to live.

<p>Writing and Speaking March 2012I&rsquo;m not a very good speaker. I say &ldquo;um&rdquo; a lot. Sometimes I have to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better speaker. But I don&rsquo;t wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer. What I really want is to have good ideas, and that&rsquo;s a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a good speaker.Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you&rsquo;re talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you&rsquo;ll be perceived as having a good style. With speaking it&rsquo;s the opposite: having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good speaker.I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online like I usually do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the other guy&rsquo;s talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he hadn&rsquo;t said very much.Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered in speaking than writing. [1]A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he good. So I decided I&rsquo;d pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he did it. After about ten sentences I found myself thinking &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a good speaker.&ldquo;Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas, but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction. For example, when I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand. I know that&rsquo;s a mistake; I know delivering a prewritten talk makes it harder to engage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full attention, and when you&rsquo;re delivering a prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between the audience and the talk — even if you&rsquo;ve memorized it. If you want to engage an audience, it&rsquo;s better to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual sentences. But if you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about each sentence than it takes to say it. [2] Occasionally the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there&rsquo;s a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better. Actors don&rsquo;t face that temptation, except in the rare cases where they&rsquo;ve written the script, but any speaker does. Before I give a talk I can usually be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on paper, trying to rehearse it in my head. But I always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead. Every talk I give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten. Which of course makes me um even more, because I haven&rsquo;t had any time to practice the new bits. [3]Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter. That&rsquo;s true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it. Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort, just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones. Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did. [4]So are talks useless? They&rsquo;re certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that&rsquo;s not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it&rsquo;s usually because I&rsquo;m interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn&rsquo;t have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him.Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It&rsquo;s probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It&rsquo;s probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that this force was more often used for good than ill, but I&rsquo;m not sure.Notes[1] I&rsquo;m not talking here about academic talks, which are a different type of thing. While the audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas you&rsquo;re presenting.[2] That&rsquo;s the lower bound. In practice you can often do better, because talks are usually about things you&rsquo;ve written or talked about before, and when you ad lib, you end up reproducing some of those sentences. Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks are made of spolia. Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally, because you have to deliver these sentences as if you&rsquo;d just thought of them.[3] Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward parts. I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at least once for that reason.[4] For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being part of an audience makes people dumber. The real decline seems to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like a conversation — maybe around 10 people. Thanks to Sam Altman and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>How to Start a Startup Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. March 2005(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer Society.)You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.And that&rsquo;s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.If there is one message I&rsquo;d like to get across about startups, that&rsquo;s it. There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.The IdeaIn particular, you don&rsquo;t need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn&rsquo;t take brilliance to do better.Google&rsquo;s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn&rsquo;t suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year. [1]There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search was before Google. I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn&rsquo;t suck.For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project. And yet there&rsquo;s a lot of money at stake. Online dating is a valuable business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it worked.An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you&rsquo;ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft&rsquo;s original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn&rsquo;t occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they&rsquo;re not transferrable. They&rsquo;re not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can&rsquo;t save bad people. PeopleWhat do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? It might be hard to translate that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows what it means. It means someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won&rsquo;t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. You could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till they&rsquo;d signed up.If you think about people you know, you&rsquo;ll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person&rsquo;s image to mind and imagine the sentence &ldquo;so-and-so is an animal.&rdquo; If you laugh, they&rsquo;re not. You don&rsquo;t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.For programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could they actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, could we stand to have them around?That last test filters out surprisingly few people. We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart. What we couldn&rsquo;t stand were people with a lot of attitude. But most of those weren&rsquo;t truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.When nerds are unbearable it&rsquo;s usually because they&rsquo;re trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand x well enough.&ldquo;This technique doesn&rsquo;t always work, because people can be influenced by their environment. In the MIT CS department, there seems to be a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I&rsquo;m told it derives ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager. Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances.It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; of anyone I&rsquo;ve met. (At least, he was before he became a professor at MIT.) No one dared put on attitude around Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had zero attitude himself.Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews. [2]It&rsquo;s no coincidence that startups start around universities, because that&rsquo;s where smart people meet. It&rsquo;s not what people learn in classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies spring up around them. They could sing campfire songs in the classes so long as admissions worked the same.If you start a startup, there&rsquo;s a good chance it will be with people you know from college or grad school. So in theory you ought to try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school, right? Well, no. Don&rsquo;t make a conscious effort to schmooze; that doesn&rsquo;t work well with hackers.What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don&rsquo;t plan to start startups, because it&rsquo;s the only real way to learn how to program. In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers. The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn&rsquo;t aim too directly at either target. Don&rsquo;t force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.Ideally you want between two and four founders. It would be hard to start with just one. One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear. Even Bill Gates, who seems to be able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. But you don&rsquo;t want so many founders that the company starts to look like a group photo. Partly because you don&rsquo;t need a lot of people at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse disagreements you&rsquo;ll have. When there are just two or three founders, you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish. If there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into factions. You don&rsquo;t want mere voting; you need unanimity.In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders should include technical people. During the Internet Bubble there were a number of startups founded by business people who then went looking for hackers to create their product for them. This doesn&rsquo;t work well. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology, because they don&rsquo;t know what the options are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy. And when business people try to hire hackers, they can&rsquo;t tell which ones are good. Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. For business people it&rsquo;s roulette.Do the founders of a startup have to include business people? That depends. We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called &ldquo;business&rdquo; if they would be the president. But they all said no, so I had to do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It&rsquo;s not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of doing it. I wanted to work in the pure, intellectual world of software, not deal with customers&rsquo; mundane problems. People who don&rsquo;t want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop a protective incompetence at it. Paul Erdos was particularly good at this. By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for math. Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same trick to some degree.Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared. There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don&rsquo;t need to know about those in a startup. All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you&rsquo;ll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don&rsquo;t hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you&rsquo;d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA. [3]There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business people can do this&ndash; that hackers can implement software, but not design it. That&rsquo;s nonsense. There&rsquo;s nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.If you can&rsquo;t understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.What Customers WantIt&rsquo;s not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don&rsquo;t give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming. It&rsquo;s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It&rsquo;s more straightforward just to make the food good.It&rsquo;s the same with technology. You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail. But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed?In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn&rsquo;t want the product. For most, the cause of death is listed as &ldquo;ran out of funding,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s only the immediate cause. Why couldn&rsquo;t they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you can. But I decided not to, because that&rsquo;s implicit in making something customers want. The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.The other approach is what I call the &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; strategy. You make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to develop it (people who do this tend to use the term &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; for hackers), and then find after a year that you&rsquo;ve spent two million dollars to develop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying that therefore had to be carefully planned.We never even considered that approach. As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it&rsquo;s certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants. But it turned out they didn&rsquo;t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site. It would be too easy for clients to fire them. We also thought we&rsquo;d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick&rsquo;s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers. But most of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction to focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.I learned something valuable from that. It&rsquo;s worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you&rsquo;re riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn&rsquo;t just increase your sales 10%. It&rsquo;s more likely to double your sales.How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn&rsquo;t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research. We didn&rsquo;t just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores. Which meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them about what they needed.No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you&rsquo;re developing technology for money, you&rsquo;re probably not going to be developing it for people like you. Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google. Everyone knows these, because they&rsquo;re big consumer brands. But for every startup like that, there are twenty more that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you&rsquo;ll start one of those.Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper. The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return. This imbalance equals opportunity.If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it&rsquo;s easier to sell to them. It&rsquo;s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can&rsquo;t outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers. [4]They&rsquo;re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end always eats the high end. It&rsquo;s easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper. So the products that start as cheap, simple options tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a room, they squash the &ldquo;high-end&rdquo; products against the ceiling. Sun did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun. Microsoft Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and Framemaker. Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive models made for professionals. Avid did it to the manufacturers of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to Avid. Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded him. If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you&rsquo;ll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you&rsquo;ll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.It&rsquo;s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you&rsquo;ll own the low end. And if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re in the crosshairs of whoever does.Raising MoneyTo make all this happen, you&rsquo;re going to need money. Some startups have been self-funding&ndash; Microsoft for example&ndash; but most aren&rsquo;t. I think it&rsquo;s wise to take money from investors. To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it&rsquo;s hard to switch from that to a product company.Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course. The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company&rsquo;s chances of succeeding, not to maximize the amount of stock you retain. So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it&rsquo;s probably a smart move.To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process. Actually it&rsquo;s merely tedious. I&rsquo;ll try to give an outline of how it works.The first thing you&rsquo;ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype. This is called seed capital. Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy&ndash; at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called &ldquo;angels.&rdquo; Often they&rsquo;re people who themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don&rsquo;t expect you to have an elaborate business plan. Most know that they&rsquo;re supposed to decide quickly. It&rsquo;s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page agreement.We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian. But he gave us a lot more than money. He&rsquo;s a former CEO and also a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company. Plus he introduced us to one of the two angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do. But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to remind themselves what they invested in.Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I&rsquo;m amazed how much worry it caused me. &ldquo;Business plan&rdquo; has that word &ldquo;business&rdquo; in it, so I figured it had to be something I&rsquo;d have to read a book about business plans to write. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t. At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you&rsquo;re going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders. If you just sit down and write out what you&rsquo;ve been saying to one another, that should be fine. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple hours, and you&rsquo;ll probably find that writing it all down gives you more ideas about what to do.For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you&rsquo;re going to have to have some kind of company. Merely incorporating yourselves isn&rsquo;t hard. The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have. If there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both equally committed to the business, that&rsquo;s easy. But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard. And once you&rsquo;ve done it, it tends to be set in stone.I have no tricks for dealing with this problem. All I can say is, try hard to do it right. I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing when you have, though. When everyone feels they&rsquo;re getting a slightly bad deal, that they&rsquo;re doing more than they should for the amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation, various things with the IRS. I&rsquo;m not even sure what the list is, because we, ah, skipped all that. When we got real funding near the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything retroactively. It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if you don&rsquo;t do everything you&rsquo;re supposed to when starting a company. And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started. [5]It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start another company doing the same thing. This does happen. So when you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone&rsquo;s ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone&rsquo;s only job.[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]While you&rsquo;re at it, you should ask what else they&rsquo;ve signed. One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into intellectual property problems. We did, and it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school. In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software. So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out. The problem was, since we&rsquo;d been about to be acquired, we&rsquo;d allowed ourselves to run low on cash. Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it&rsquo;s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can&rsquo;t judge how serious it is.Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word &ldquo;angel&rdquo; is a metaphor. The founders thereupon proposed to walk away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial on how to administer the servers themselves. And while this was happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on the deal.Miraculously it all turned out ok. The investors backed down; we did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn&rsquo;t own our software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay. So we were happy in the end, though the experience probably took several years off my life.Don&rsquo;t do what we did. Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history.Once you&rsquo;ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch of guys with some ideas. But when you look at it from the rich people&rsquo;s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich people are looking for good investments. If you really think you have a chance of succeeding, you&rsquo;re doing them a favor by letting them invest. Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders. They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds. How much stock should they get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you&rsquo;re implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company. Venture investments are usually described in terms of that number. If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you&rsquo;ve done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.How do you decide what the value of the company should be? There is no rational way. At this stage the company is just a bet. I didn&rsquo;t realize that when we were raising money. Julian thought we ought to value the company at several million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars. Eventually we settled on one million, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower. [6]What I didn&rsquo;t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn&rsquo;t just the value of the code we&rsquo;d written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we&rsquo;d do, which turned out to be a lot.The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with actual venture capital firms. But don&rsquo;t wait till you&rsquo;ve burned through your last round of funding to start approaching them. VCs are slow to make up their minds. They can take months. You don&rsquo;t want to be running out of money while you&rsquo;re trying to negotiate with them.Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels. The amounts of money involved are larger, millions usually. So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose more onerous conditions.Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced, with a business background. Maybe in some cases this is true. And yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business background, and he seems to have done ok. Steve Jobs got booted out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company. So I think people who are mature and experienced, with a business background, may be overrated. We used to call these guys &ldquo;newscasters,&rdquo; because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and generally didn&rsquo;t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing our startup entirely with angel money. The main reason was that we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as part of the deal. That might have been ok if he was content to limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to have a say in running the company? That would have led to disaster, because our software was so complex. We were a company whose whole m.o. was to win through better technology. The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn&rsquo;t need any help with those.This was also one reason we didn&rsquo;t go public. Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it. In those days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues, we might have done well. But I feared it would have meant taking on a newscaster&ndash; someone who, as they say, &ldquo;can talk Wall Street&rsquo;s language.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to see Google is bucking that trend. They didn&rsquo;t talk Wall Street&rsquo;s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street didn&rsquo;t buy. And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself. They&rsquo;ll pay attention next time. Wall Street learns new languages fast when money is involved.You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize. The reason is other VCs. I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk to them you realize that it&rsquo;s a seller&rsquo;s market. Even now there is too much money chasing too few good deals.VCs form a pyramid. At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you&rsquo;ve never heard of. What they all have in common is that a dollar from them is worth one dollar. Most VCs will tell you that they don&rsquo;t just provide money, but connections and advice. If you&rsquo;re talking to Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true. But such advice and connections can come very expensive. And as you go down the food chain the VCs get rapidly dumber. A few steps down from the top you&rsquo;re basically talking to bankers who&rsquo;ve picked up a few new vocabulary words from reading Wired. (Does your product use XML?) So I&rsquo;d advise you to be skeptical about claims of experience and connections. Basically, a VC is a source of money. I&rsquo;d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.You may wonder how much to tell VCs. And you should, because some of them may one day be funding your competitors. I think the best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either. After all, as most VCs say, they&rsquo;re more interested in the people than the ideas. The main reason they want to talk about your idea is to judge you, not the idea. So as long as you seem like you know what you&rsquo;re doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. [7]Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don&rsquo;t want their money, because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, and b) if you seem impressive, they&rsquo;ll be discouraged from investing in your competitors. The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially if you only want them to know about you and don&rsquo;t want their money, is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups to present to them.Not Spending ItWhen and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you do with it? Not spend it, that&rsquo;s what. In nearly every startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something deeper wrong. But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to avoid.During the Bubble many startups tried to &ldquo;get big fast.&rdquo; Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast. But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable. But even that may be overrated. The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for competitors. But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so overwhelmingly great. Google is again a case in point. When they appeared it seemed as if search was a mature market, dominated by big players who&rsquo;d spent millions to build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi. Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing in the search business. You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you. As if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising. They&rsquo;re like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use it themselves.The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those millions improving their software. Future startups should learn from that mistake. Unless you&rsquo;re in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage. And few if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated. The dating sites are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the more evidence they&rsquo;re ripe for the picking. (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell a company run by marketing guys.)We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect it was a good thing. The founders all learned to do every job in the company. As well as writing software, I had to do sales and customer support. At sales I was not very good. I was persistent, but I didn&rsquo;t have the smoothness of a good salesman. My message to potential customers was: you&rsquo;d be stupid not to sell online, and if you sell online you&rsquo;d be stupid to use anyone else&rsquo;s software. Both statements were true, but that&rsquo;s not the way to convince people.I was great at customer support though. Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them, because when you&rsquo;re growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves. There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. If you listen to them, they&rsquo;ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they&rsquo;ll pay you.We officially launched in early 1996. By the end of that year we had about 70 users. Since this was the era of &ldquo;get big fast,&rdquo; I worried about how small and obscure we were. But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing. Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product. That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software. By the end of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up. And since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better than anyone else.That&rsquo;s the key to success as a startup. There is nothing more important than understanding your business. You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it. Far from it. Google&rsquo;s secret weapon was simply that they understood search. I was working for Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn&rsquo;t understand search. I know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere &ldquo;search engine.&rdquo; Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than one month&rsquo;s growth, and now that we were established as a &ldquo;media company,&rdquo; or &ldquo;portal,&rdquo; or whatever we were, search could safely be allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions start with. I think Yahoo gets that now.Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don&rsquo;t. The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren&rsquo;t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads &ldquo;if the people lead, the leaders will follow.&rdquo; Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes &ldquo;get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.&rdquo; More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don&rsquo;t put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder that is. So I say &ldquo;get big slow.&rdquo; The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness. That&rsquo;s something Yahoo did understand. David Filo&rsquo;s title was &ldquo;Chief Yahoo,&rdquo; but he was proud that his unofficial title was &ldquo;Cheap Yahoo.&rdquo; Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy, asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on expensive RAID drives. I was impressed by that. Yahoo&rsquo;s market cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk space.When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich. It&rsquo;s important to realize you&rsquo;re not. A rich company is one with large revenues. This money isn&rsquo;t revenue. It&rsquo;s money investors have given you in the hope you&rsquo;ll be able to generate revenues. So despite those millions in the bank, you&rsquo;re still poor.For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive. For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs. The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups. Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs. We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square. It had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom. It must once have been inhabited by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against cosmic rays. When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit sheepish about the low production values. But in fact that place was the perfect space for a startup. We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that is exactly the spirit you want.An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, as you&rsquo;ve probably discovered if you&rsquo;ve tried it. Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than at work? So why not make work more like home?When you&rsquo;re looking for space for a startup, don&rsquo;t feel that it has to look professional. Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls. I&rsquo;d advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment. You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings. And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that&rsquo;s a wasteland after 6:00 PM. Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you&rsquo;ve lost something extraordinarily valuable. God help you if you actually start in that mode.If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three places I&rsquo;d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone&rsquo;s office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better.During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy. They wanted to get &ldquo;staffed up&rdquo; as soon as possible, as if you couldn&rsquo;t get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding job title. That&rsquo;s big company thinking. Don&rsquo;t hire people to fill the gaps in some a priori org chart. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you&rsquo;d like to do but can&rsquo;t.If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do it? I think the main reason is that people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them. This weakness often extends right up to the CEO. If you ever end up running a company, you&rsquo;ll find the most common question people ask is how many employees you have. This is their way of weighing you. It&rsquo;s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they&rsquo;re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it&rsquo;s ten.This is ridiculous, really. If two companies have the same revenues, it&rsquo;s the one with fewer employees that&rsquo;s more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered &ldquo;twenty,&rdquo; I could see them thinking that we didn&rsquo;t count for much. I used to want to add &ldquo;but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?&ldquo;As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice between seeming impressive, and being impressive. Any of you who were nerds in high school know about this choice. Keep doing it when you start a company.Should You?But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person to do it? If you are, is it worth it?More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than realize it. That&rsquo;s the main reason I wrote this. There could be ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be a good thing.I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a startup. But the idea terrified me at first. I was forced into it because I was a Lisp hacker. The company I&rsquo;d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there were not a lot of other companies using Lisp. Since I couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995, remember, when &ldquo;another language&rdquo; meant C++) the only option seemed to be to start a new company using Lisp.I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you&rsquo;re a Lisp hacker you&rsquo;ll know what I mean. And if the idea of starting a startup frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too intimidated to try.So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.I can&rsquo;t say precisely what a good hacker is. At a first rate university this might include the top half of computer science majors. Though of course you don&rsquo;t have to be a CS major to be a hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.It&rsquo;s hard to tell whether you&rsquo;re a good hacker, especially when you&rsquo;re young. Fortunately the process of starting startups tends to select them automatically. What drives people to start startups is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don&rsquo;t these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z? And that&rsquo;s also a sign that one is a good hacker.I put the lower bound at 23 not because there&rsquo;s something that doesn&rsquo;t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see what it&rsquo;s like in an existing business before you try running your own. The business doesn&rsquo;t have to be a startup. I spent a year working for a software company to pay off my college loans. It was the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don&rsquo;t have a lot of meetings; don&rsquo;t have chunks of code that multiple people own; don&rsquo;t have a sales guy running the company; don&rsquo;t make a high-end product; don&rsquo;t let your code get too big; don&rsquo;t leave finding bugs to QA people; don&rsquo;t go too long between releases; don&rsquo;t isolate developers from users; don&rsquo;t move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones. Perhaps even more valuable: it&rsquo;s hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it&rsquo;s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]The other reason it&rsquo;s hard to start a company before 23 is that people won&rsquo;t take you seriously. VCs won&rsquo;t trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you&rsquo;re going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you&rsquo;re very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you&rsquo;ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you&rsquo;re 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to. Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft. (Paul Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if you&rsquo;re thinking, I don&rsquo;t care what he says, I&rsquo;m going to start a company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with it.The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it. One reason I put it there is that I don&rsquo;t think many people have the physical stamina much past that age. I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week. I don&rsquo;t know if I could do that now.Also, startups are a big risk financially. If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke. By 38 you can&rsquo;t take so many risks&ndash; especially if you have kids.My final test may be the most restrictive. Do you actually want to start a startup? What it amounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. And maybe end up with nothing&ndash; though in that case it probably won&rsquo;t take four years.During this time you&rsquo;ll do little but work, because when you&rsquo;re not working, your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend&rsquo;s house for dinner. I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends. Sometimes it was even technically interesting. But only about 10% of the time. The best I can say for the other 90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then. Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours, and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered generator inside our offices. I won&rsquo;t try that again.I don&rsquo;t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is more than you&rsquo;d endure in an ordinary working life. It&rsquo;s probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it&rsquo;s compressed into a short period. So mainly what a startup buys you is time. That&rsquo;s the way to think about it if you&rsquo;re trying to decide whether to start one. If you&rsquo;re the sort of person who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate school. Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people, to start software startups. You may worry that if you do you&rsquo;ll blow your chances of an academic career. But it&rsquo;s possible to be part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first. Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole time, and both got their degrees. There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won&rsquo;t be for too long. If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life. And if it succeeds, you may find you no longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.If you want to do it, do it. Starting a startup is not the great mystery it seems from outside. It&rsquo;s not something you have to know about &ldquo;business&rdquo; to do. Build something users love, and spend less than you make. How hard is that?Notes[1] Google&rsquo;s revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes from ads on other sites.[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses. For example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon. But you&rsquo;re not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids soon. Believe it or not, under current US law, you&rsquo;re not even allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence. Whereas when you&rsquo;re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because you can do it mostly on your own. For the price of a Linux box, a copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor&rsquo;s fifteen year old son, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way.[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government. Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology. But let someone else start those startups.[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care about the paperwork there, and that there&rsquo;s more of it. Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany.[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because Julian got 10% of the company. But this is a very misleading number, because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you. There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick your brains. But you can never tell for sure which these are, so the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention a few critical technical secrets.[8] I was as bad an employee as this place was a company. I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.[9] You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this essay, and to Steve Melendez and Gregory Price for inviting me to speak.Domain Name SearchTurkish TranslationHebrew TranslationRussian TranslationChinese TranslationFrench TranslationJapanese TranslationArabic Translation</p>

<p>How to Fund a Startup Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. November 2005 Venture funding works like gears. A typical startup goes through several rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next gear.Few startups get it quite right. Many are underfunded. A few are overfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.I think it would help founders to understand funding better—not just the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking. I was surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we faced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors. Dealing with competitors was easy by comparison.I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag on us. They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example. I mean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty. Competitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the balls.Apparently our situation was not unusual. And if trouble with investors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing them is one of the most important skills founders need to learn.Let&rsquo;s start by talking about the five sources of startup funding. Then we&rsquo;ll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startup as it shifts gears through successive rounds.Friends and FamilyA lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family. Excite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college, they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company. With the help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between them and angel investors. At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently rich that it&rsquo;s hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend or angel. He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meant we didn&rsquo;t have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum.The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that they&rsquo;re easy to find. You already know them. There are three main disadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life; they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture firms; and they may not be accredited investors, which could complicate your life later.The SEC defines an &ldquo;accredited investor&rdquo; as someone with over a million dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 a year. The regulatory burden is much lower if a company&rsquo;s shareholders are all accredited investors. Once you take money from the general public you&rsquo;re more restricted in what you can do. [1]A startup&rsquo;s life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the investors aren&rsquo;t accredited. In an IPO, it might not merely add expense, but change the outcome. A lawyer I asked about it said: When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws. Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO. Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small. But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end up going public didn&rsquo;t seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed that the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling plans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the decade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny probability multiplied by the huge outcome.It wasn&rsquo;t because they weren&rsquo;t accredited investors that I didn&rsquo;t ask my parents for seed money, though. When we were starting Viaweb, I didn&rsquo;t know about the concept of an accredited investor, and didn&rsquo;t stop to think about the value of investors&rsquo; connections. The reason I didn&rsquo;t take money from my parents was that I didn&rsquo;t want them to lose it.ConsultingAnother way to fund a startup is to get a job. The best sort of job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software you wanted to sell as a startup. Then you can gradually transform yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have your clients pay your development expenses.This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most of the risk out of starting a startup. There never has to be a time when you have no revenues. Risk and reward are usually proportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk of starting a startup also to cut the average return. In this case, you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your company won&rsquo;t succeed as a startup.But isn&rsquo;t the consulting company itself a startup? No, not generally. A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a startup. There are millions of small businesses in America, but only a few thousand are startups. To be a startup, a company has to be a product business, not a service business. By which I mean not that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work for individual clients. Custom work doesn&rsquo;t scale. To be a startup you need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, not the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar mitzvahs.The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit of calling you on the phone. Most startups operate close to the margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients could be enough to put you over the edge. Especially if you have competitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route. You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a &ldquo;weed tree,&rdquo; dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money. [2]Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you an excuse for failure. In a startup, as in grad school, a lot of what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and friends. Once you start a startup and tell everyone that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re now on a path labelled &ldquo;get rich or bust.&rdquo; You now have to get rich, or you&rsquo;ve failed.Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force. Usually it prevents people from starting things, but once you publish some definite ambition, it switches directions and starts working in your favor. I think it&rsquo;s a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set this irresistible force against the slightly less immovable object of becoming rich. You won&rsquo;t have it driving you if your stated ambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one day morph into a startup.An advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is that you know you&rsquo;re making something at least one customer wants. But if you have what it takes to start a startup you should have sufficient vision not to need this crutch.Angel InvestorsAngels are individual rich people. The word was first used for backers of Broadway plays, but now applies to individual investors generally. Angels who&rsquo;ve made money in technology are preferable, for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they&rsquo;re a source of contacts and advice.The contacts and advice can be more important than the money. When del.icio.us took money from investors, they took money from, among others, Tim O&rsquo;Reilly. The amount he put in was small compared to the VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guy and it&rsquo;s good to have him on your side.You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends and family. With angels we&rsquo;re now talking about venture funding proper, so it&rsquo;s time to introduce the concept of exit strategy. Younger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expect them either to sell the company or go public. The reason is that investors need to get their capital back. They&rsquo;ll only consider companies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that could get bought or go public.This is not as selfish as it sounds. There are few large, private technology companies. Those that don&rsquo;t fail all seem to get bought or go public. The reason is that employees are investors too—of their time—and they want just as much to be able to cash out. If your competitors offer employees stock options that might make them rich, while you make it clear you plan to stay private, your competitors will get the best people. So the principle of an &ldquo;exit&rdquo; is not just something forced on startups by investors, but part of what it means to be a startup.Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation. When someone buys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value for it. If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a company, the company is in theory worth $200,000. I say &ldquo;in theory&rdquo; because in early stage investing, valuations are voodoo. As a company gets more established, its valuation gets closer to an actual market value. But in a newly founded startup, the valuation number is just an artifact of the respective contributions of everyone involved.Startups often &ldquo;pay&rdquo; investors who will help the company in some way by letting them invest at low valuations. If I had a startup and Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I&rsquo;d give him the stock for $10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s impractical (if not illegal) to adjust the valuation of the company up and down for each investor. Startups&rsquo; valuations are supposed to rise over time. So if you&rsquo;re going to sell cheap stock to eminent angels, do it early, when it&rsquo;s natural for the company to have a low valuation.Some angel investors join together in syndicates. Any city where people start startups will have one or more of them. In Boston the biggest is the Common Angels. In the Bay Area it&rsquo;s the Band of Angels. You can find groups near you through the Angel Capital Association. [3] However, most angel investors don&rsquo;t belong to these groups. In fact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to belong to a group.Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them. Needless to say, you should never do this.One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels, rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they have less reputation to protect. A big-name VC firm will not screw you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if word got out. With individual angels you don&rsquo;t have this protection, as we found to our dismay in our own startup. In many startups&rsquo; lives there comes a point when you&rsquo;re at the investors&rsquo; mercy—when you&rsquo;re out of money and the only place to get more is your existing investors. When we got into such a scrape, our investors took advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn&rsquo;t have.Angels have a corresponding advantage, however: they&rsquo;re also not bound by all the rules that VC firms are. And so they can, for example, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round, by selling some of their stock directly to the investors. I think this will become more common; the average founder is eager to do it, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock will not, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed to the business.The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and so on balance I&rsquo;m grateful rather than angry. (As in families, relations between founders and investors can be complicated.)The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions. You could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, like VCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they respect.Deal terms with angels vary a lot. There are no generally accepted standards. Sometimes angels&rsquo; deal terms are as fearsome as VCs&rsquo;. Other angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest based on a two-page agreement.Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what terms they want. They just want to invest in this startup. What kind of anti-dilution protection do they want? Hell if they know. In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms end up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla. Which in practice usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around his firm. (Few legal documents are created from scratch.)These heaps o&rsquo; boilerplate are a problem for small startups, because they tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents. I know of one startup that got from an angel investor what amounted to a five hundred pound handshake: after deciding to invest, the angel presented them with a 70-page agreement. The startup didn&rsquo;t have enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it, let alone negotiate the terms, so the deal fell through.One solution to this problem would be to have the startup&rsquo;s lawyer produce the agreement, instead of the angel&rsquo;s. Some angels might balk at this, but others would probably welcome it.Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to write that big check. In our startup, one of the two angels in the initial round took months to pay us, and only did after repeated nagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.It&rsquo;s obvious why investors delay. Investing in startups is risky! When a company is only two months old, every day you wait gives you 1.7% more data about their trajectory. But the investor is already being compensated for that risk in the low price of the stock, so it is unfair to delay.Fair or not, investors do it if you let them. Even VCs do it. And funding delays are a big distraction for founders, who ought to be working on their company, not worrying about investors. What&rsquo;s a startup to do? With both investors and acquirers, the only leverage you have is competition. If an investor knows you have other investors lined up, he&rsquo;ll be a lot more eager to close&ndash; and not just because he&rsquo;ll worry about losing the deal, but because if other investors are interested, you must be worth investing in. It&rsquo;s the same with acquisitions. No one wants to buy you till someone else wants to buy you, and then everyone wants to buy you.The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives. When an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirer says they want to buy you, don&rsquo;t believe it till you get the check. Your natural tendency when an investor says yes will be to relax and go back to writing code. Alas, you can&rsquo;t; you have to keep looking for more investors, if only to get this one to act. [4]Seed Funding FirmsSeed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small amounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they&rsquo;re companies that do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasional investments on the side.Till now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called &ldquo;incubators,&rdquo; so Y Combinator gets called one too, though the only thing we have in common is that we invest in the earliest phase.According to the National Association of Business Incubators, there are about 800 incubators in the US. This is an astounding number, because I know the founders of a lot of startups, and I can&rsquo;t think of one that began in an incubator.What is an incubator? I&rsquo;m not sure myself. The defining quality seems to be that you work in their space. That&rsquo;s where the name &ldquo;incubator&rdquo; comes from. They seem to vary a great deal in other respects. At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant building as a &ldquo;high-tech incubator,&rdquo; as if it were merely lack of the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town from becoming a startup hub. At the other extreme are places like Idealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires people to work for them.The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead, were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the startups they funded. In addition to working in their space, you were supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and so on.Whereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs, Y Combinator exerts less. And we think it&rsquo;s better if startups operate out of their own premises, however crappy, than the offices of their investors. So it&rsquo;s annoying that we keep getting called an &ldquo;incubator,&rdquo; but perhaps inevitable, because there&rsquo;s only one of us so far and no word yet for what we are. If we have to be called something, the obvious name would be &ldquo;excubator.&rdquo; (The name is more excusable if one considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people, reaching them is easier than reaching angels. Just go to their web site and send them an email. The importance of personal introductions varies, but is less than with angels or VCs.The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment process is more standardized. (This is generally true with angel groups too.) Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they use for every startup they fund. The fact that the deal terms are standard doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re favorable to you, but if other startups have signed the same agreements and things went well for them, it&rsquo;s a sign the terms are reasonable.Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively in the earliest phases—often when the company is still just an idea. Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this, but they also invest at later stages.The problems are different in the early stages. For example, in the first couple months a startup may completely redefine their idea. So seed investors usually care less about the idea than the people. This is true of all venture funding, but especially so in the seed stage.Like VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they offer. But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase, they need to offer different kinds of advice. For example, a seed firm should be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCs obviously don&rsquo;t need to do; whereas VCs should be able to give advice about how to hire an &ldquo;executive team,&rdquo; which is not an issue in the seed stage.In the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so seed firms should be able to help with technical as well as business problems.Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the initial phases of a startup, then hand them off to VC firms for the next round. Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct to acquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasingly common.Google has been aggressively pursuing this route, and now Yahoo is too. Both now compete directly with VCs. And this is a smart move. Why wait for further funding rounds to jack up a startup&rsquo;s price? When a startup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to invest in it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy it. More information, in fact; with their technical depth, the acquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.Venture Capital FundsVC firms are like seed firms in that they&rsquo;re actual companies, but they invest other people&rsquo;s money, and much larger amounts of it. VC investments average several million dollars. So they tend to come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come with tougher terms.The word &ldquo;venture capitalist&rdquo; is sometimes used loosely for any venture investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs and other investors: VC firms are organized as funds, much like hedge funds or mutual funds. The fund managers, who are called &ldquo;general partners,&rdquo; get about 2% of the fund annually as a management fee, plus about 20% of the fund&rsquo;s gains.There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, because in the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating. When an investment scores spectacularly, as Google did for Kleiner and Sequoia, it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs. And many founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, because of the legitimacy it confers. Hence a vicious (for the losers) cycle: VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the deals the bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.As a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, only about 50 are likely to make money, and it is very hard for a new fund to break into this group.In a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders. They may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big-name firms, but they are much hungrier for deals. This means you should be able to get better terms from them.Better how? The most obvious is valuation: they&rsquo;ll take less of your company. But as well as money, there&rsquo;s power. I think founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms that will make it fairly hard to fire them later.The most dramatic change, I predict, is that VCs will allow founders to cash out partially by selling some of their stock direct to the VC firm. VCs have traditionally resisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate &ldquo;liquidity event.&rdquo; But they&rsquo;re also desperate for deals. And since I know from my own experience that the rule against buying stock from founders is a stupid one, this is a natural place for things to give as venture funding becomes more and more a seller&rsquo;s market.The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that people will assume, correctly or not, that you were turned down by the more exalted ones. But, like where you went to college, the name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to measure. So the more confident you are, the less you need a brand-name VC. We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money; it never occurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make us seem more impressive. [5]Another danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they have less reputation to protect. I suspect it&rsquo;s the lower-tier firms that are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs such a bad reputation among hackers. They are doubly hosed: the general partners themselves are less able, and yet they have harder problems to solve, because the top VCs skim off all the best deals, leaving the lower-tier firms exactly the startups that are likely to blow up.For example, lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend to want to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide if they really want to. One experienced CFO said: The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they really want to do a deal. The second or third tier firms have a much higher break rate—it could be as high as 50%. It&rsquo;s obvious why: the lower-tier firms&rsquo; biggest fear, when chance throws them a bone, is that one of the big dogs will notice and take it away. The big dogs don&rsquo;t have to worry about that.Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you. As one VC told me: If you were talking to four VCs, told three of them that you accepted a term sheet, and then have to call them back to tell them you were just kidding, you are absolutely damaged goods. Here&rsquo;s a partial solution: when a VC offers you a term sheet, ask how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals. This will at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners. Most firms also have a handful of junior employees called something like associates or analysts. If you get a call from a VC firm, go to their web site and check whether the person you talked to is a partner. Odds are it will be a junior person; they scour the web looking for startups their bosses could invest in. The junior people will tend to seem very positive about your company. They&rsquo;re not pretending; they want to believe you&rsquo;re a hot prospect, because it would be a huge coup for them if their firm invested in a company they discovered. Don&rsquo;t be misled by this optimism. It&rsquo;s the partners who decide, and they view things with a colder eye.Because VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with more restrictions. Most only come into effect if the company gets into trouble. For example, VCs generally write it into the deal that in any sale, they get their investment back first. So if the company gets sold at a low price, the founders could get nothing. Some VCs now require that in any sale they get 4x their investment back before the common stock holders (that is, you) get anything, but this is an abuse that should be resisted.Another difference with large investments is that the founders are usually required to accept &ldquo;vesting&rdquo;—to surrender their stock and earn it back over the next 4-5 years. VCs don&rsquo;t want to invest millions in a company the founders could just walk away from. Financially, vesting has little effect, but in some situations it could mean founders will have less power. If VCs got de facto control of the company and fired one of the founders, he&rsquo;d lose any unvested stock unless there was specific protection against this. So vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line.The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is that the founders will no longer have complete control. Ten years ago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand the job over to a business guy they supplied. This is less the rule now, partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that generic business guys don&rsquo;t make such great CEOs.But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, they&rsquo;ll have to cede some power, because the board of directors will become more powerful. In the seed stage, the board is generally a formality; if you want to talk to the other board members, you just yell into the next room. This stops with VC-scale money. In a typical VC funding deal, the board of directors might be composed of two VCs, two founders, and one outside person acceptable to both. The board will have ultimate power, which means the founders now have to convince instead of commanding.This is not as bad as it sounds, however. Bill Gates is in the same position; he doesn&rsquo;t have majority control of Microsoft; in principle he also has to convince instead of commanding. And yet he seems pretty commanding, doesn&rsquo;t he? As long as things are going smoothly, boards don&rsquo;t interfere much. The danger comes when there&rsquo;s a bump in the road, as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple.Like angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through people they know. So while nearly all VC funds have some address you can send your business plan to, VCs privately admit the chance of getting funding by this route is near zero. One recently told me that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way.I suspect VCs accept business plans &ldquo;over the transom&rdquo; more as a way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals. In fact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan randomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness. Do the extra work of getting personal introductions. As one VC put it: I&rsquo;m not hard to find. I know a lot of people. If you can&rsquo;t find some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful company? One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding when to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because they rely heavily on first impressions. And you can&rsquo;t approach some and save others for later, because (a) they ask who else you&rsquo;ve talked to and when and (b) they talk among themselves. If you&rsquo;re talking to one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another several months ago, you&rsquo;ll definitely seem shopworn.So when do you approach VCs? When you can convince them. If the founders have impressive resumes and the idea isn&rsquo;t hard to understand, you could approach VCs quite early. Whereas if the founders are unknown and the idea is very novel, you might have to launch the thing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.If several VCs are interested in you, they will sometimes be willing to split the deal between them. They&rsquo;re more likely to do this if they&rsquo;re close in the VC pecking order. Such deals may be a net win for founders, because you get multiple VCs interested in your success, and you can ask each for advice about the other. One founder I know wrote: Two-firm deals are great. It costs you a little more equity, but being able to play the two firms off each other (as well as ask one if the other is being out of line) is invaluable. When you do negotiate with VCs, remember that they&rsquo;ve done this a lot more than you have. They&rsquo;ve invested in dozens of startups, whereas this is probably the first you&rsquo;ve founded. But don&rsquo;t let them or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarter than the average VC. So just do what you&rsquo;d do in any complex, unfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anything that seems odd.It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreement whose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCs to defend things they do by saying that they&rsquo;re standard in the industry. Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a few decades old, and rapidly evolving. The concept of &ldquo;standard&rdquo; is a useful one when you&rsquo;re operating on a small scale (Y Combinator uses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed-stage investments it&rsquo;s not worth the overhead of negotiating individual deals), but it doesn&rsquo;t apply at the VC level. On that scale, every negotiation is unique.Most successful startups get money from more than one of the preceding five sources. [6] And, confusingly, the names of funding sources also tend to be used as the names of different rounds. The best way to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypothetical startup.Stage 1: Seed RoundOur startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea&ndash; either an idea for something they might build, or simply the idea &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start a company.&rdquo; Presumably they already have some source of food and shelter. But if you have food and shelter, you probably also have something you&rsquo;re supposed to be working on: either classwork, or a job. So if you want to work full-time on a startup, your money situation will probably change too.A lot of startup founders say they started the company without any idea of what they planned to do. This is actually less common than it seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea after quitting because otherwise their former employer would own it.The three friends decide to take the leap. Since most startups are in competitive businesses, you not only want to work full-time on them, but more than full-time. So some or all of the friends quit their jobs or leave school. (Some of the founders in a startup can stay in grad school, but at least one has to make the company his full-time job.)They&rsquo;re going to run the company out of one of their apartments at first, and since they don&rsquo;t have any users they don&rsquo;t have to pay much for infrastructure. Their main expenses are setting up the company, which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work and registration fees, and the living expenses of the founders.The phrase &ldquo;seed investment&rdquo; covers a broad range. To some VC firms it means $500,000, but to most startups it means several months&rsquo; living expenses. We&rsquo;ll suppose our group of friends start with $15,000 from their friend&rsquo;s rich uncle, who they give 5% of the company in return. There&rsquo;s only common stock at this stage. They leave 20% as an options pool for later employees (but they set things up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if they get bought early and most is still unissued), and the three founders each get 25%.By living really cheaply they think they can make the remaining money last five months. When you have five months&rsquo; runway left, how soon do you need to start looking for your next round? Answer: immediately. It takes time to find investors, and time (always more than you expect) for the deal to close even after they say yes. So if our group of founders know what they&rsquo;re doing they&rsquo;ll start sniffing around for angel investors right away. But of course their main job is to build version 1 of their software.The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase, but being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson. For a startup, cheapness is power. The lower your costs, the more options you have—not just at this stage, but at every point till you&rsquo;re profitable. When you have a high &ldquo;burn rate,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re always under time pressure, which means (a) you don&rsquo;t have time for your ideas to evolve, and (b) you&rsquo;re often forced to take deals you don&rsquo;t like.Every startup&rsquo;s rule should be: spend little, and work fast.After ten weeks&rsquo; work the three friends have built a prototype that gives one a taste of what their product will do. It&rsquo;s not what they originally set out to do—in the process of writing it, they had some new ideas. And it only does a fraction of what the finished product will do, but that fraction includes stuff that no one else has done before.They&rsquo;ve also written at least a skeleton business plan, addressing the five fundamental questions: what they&rsquo;re going to do, why users need it, how large the market is, how they&rsquo;ll make money, and who the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them. (That last has to be more specific than &ldquo;they suck&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll work really hard.&quot;)If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or the business plan, spend most on the demo. Software is not only more convincing, but a better way to explore ideas.Stage 2: Angel RoundWhile writing the prototype, the group has been traversing their network of friends in search of angel investors. They find some just as the prototype is demoable. When they demo it, one of the angels is willing to invest. Now the group is looking for more money: they want enough to last for a year, and maybe to hire a couple friends. So they&rsquo;re going to raise $200,000.The angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million. The company issues $200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; if there were 1000 shares before the deal, this means 200 additional shares. The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of the company, and all the previous shareholders&rsquo; percentage ownership is diluted by a sixth. After the deal, the capitalization table looks like this: shareholder shares percent &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- angel 200 16.7 uncle 50 4.2 each founder 250 20.8 option pool 200 16.7 &mdash;- &mdash;&ndash; total 1200 100 To keep things simple, I had the angel do a straight cash for stock deal. In reality the angel might be more likely to make the investment in the form of a convertible loan. A convertible loan is a loan that can be converted into stock later; it works out the same as a stock purchase in the end, but gives the angel more protection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds.Who pays the legal bills for this deal? The startup, remember, only has a couple thousand left. In practice this turns out to be a sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way. Maybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the hope of future work if the startup succeeds. Maybe someone has a lawyer friend. Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to represent both sides. (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer is representing you rather than merely advising you, or his only duty is to the investor.)An angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the board of directors. He might also want preferred stock, meaning a special class of stock that has some additional rights over the common stock everyone else has. Typically these rights include vetoes over major strategic decisions, protection against being diluted in future rounds, and the right to get one&rsquo;s investment back first if the company is sold.Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a sum this size, and others wouldn&rsquo;t. VCs are more likely to require vesting than angels. At Viaweb we managed to raise $2.5 million from angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we were so inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea. In practice this turned out to be good, because it made us harder to push around.Our experience was unusual; vesting is the norm for amounts that size. Y Combinator doesn&rsquo;t require vesting, because (a) we invest such small amounts, and (b) we think it&rsquo;s unnecessary, and that the hope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work. But maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently.I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect themselves against one another. It solves the problem of what to do if one of the founders quits. So some founders impose it on themselves when they start the company.The angel deal takes two weeks to close, so we are now three months into the life of the company.The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money will usually be the happiest phase in a startup&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s a lot like being a postdoc: you have no immediate financial worries, and few responsibilities. You get to work on juicy kinds of work, like designing software. You don&rsquo;t have to spend time on bureaucratic stuff, because you haven&rsquo;t hired any bureaucrats yet. Enjoy it while it lasts, and get as much done as you can, because you will never again be so productive.With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in the bank, the founders happily set to work turning their prototype into something they can release. They hire one of their friends—at first just as a consultant, so they can try him out—and then a month later as employee #1. They pay him the smallest salary he can live on, plus 3% of the company in restricted stock, vesting over four years. (So after this the option pool is down to 13.7%). [7] They also spend a little money on a freelance graphic designer.How much stock do you give early employees? That varies so much that there&rsquo;s no conventional number. If you get someone really good, really early, it might be wise to give him as much stock as the founders. The one universal rule is that the amount of stock an employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company. In other words, you get rich as a power of how early you were. So if some friends want you to come work for their startup, don&rsquo;t wait several months before deciding.A month later, at the end of month four, our group of founders have something they can launch. Gradually through word of mouth they start to get users. Seeing the system in use by real users—people they don&rsquo;t know—gives them lots of new ideas. Also they find they now worry obsessively about the status of their server. (How relaxing founders&rsquo; lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc.)By the end of month six, the system is starting to have a solid core of features, and a small but devoted following. People start to write about it, and the founders are starting to feel like experts in their field.We&rsquo;ll assume that their startup is one that could put millions more to use. Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing, or build some kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid salesmen. So they decide to start talking to VCs. They get introductions to VCs from various sources: their angel investor connects them with a couple; they meet a few at conferences; a couple VCs call them after reading about them.Step 3: Series A RoundArmed with their now somewhat fleshed-out business plan and able to demo a real, working system, the founders visit the VCs they have introductions to. They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable. They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to? (VCs are like high school girls: they&rsquo;re acutely aware of their position in the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a function of the interest other VCs show in it.)One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders a term sheet. A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms will be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the details later. By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn away other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; required for the deal. Due diligence is the corporate equivalent of a background check: the purpose is to uncover any hidden bombs that might sink the company later, like serious design flaws in the product, pending lawsuits against the company, intellectual property issues, and so on. VCs&rsquo; legal and financial due diligence is pretty thorough, but the technical due diligence is generally a joke. [8]The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs, and six weeks later they go ahead with the deal. Here are the terms: a $2 million investment at a pre-money valuation of $4 million, meaning that after the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company (2 / (4 + 2)). The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the option pool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares. So the total number of new shares issued is 750, and the cap table becomes: shareholder shares percent &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- VCs 650 33.3 angel 200 10.3 uncle 50 2.6 each founder 250 12.8 employee 36* 1.8 *unvested option pool 264 13.5 &mdash;- &mdash;&ndash; total 1950 100 This picture is unrealistic in several respects. For example, while the percentages might end up looking like this, it&rsquo;s unlikely that the VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares. In fact, every bit of the startup&rsquo;s paperwork would probably be replaced, as if the company were being founded anew. Also, the money might come in several tranches, the later ones subject to various conditions—though this is apparently more common in deals with lower-tier VCs (whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups) than with the top firms.And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floor laughing at how my hypothetical VCs let the angel keep his 10.3 of the company. I admit, this is the Bambi version; in simplifying the picture, I&rsquo;ve also made everyone nicer. In the real world, VCs regard angels the way a jealous husband feels about his wife&rsquo;s previous boyfriends. To them the company didn&rsquo;t exist before they invested in it. [9]I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression you have to do an angel round before going to VCs. In this example I stretched things out to show multiple sources of funding in action. Some startups could go directly from seed funding to a VC round; several of the companies we&rsquo;ve funded have.The founders are required to vest their shares over four years, and the board is now reconstituted to consist of two VCs, two founders, and a fifth person acceptable to both. The angel investor cheerfully surrenders his board seat.At this point there is nothing new our startup can teach us about funding—or at least, nothing good. [10] The startup will almost certainly hire more people at this point; those millions must be put to work, after all. The company may do additional funding rounds, presumably at higher valuations. They may if they are extraordinarily fortunate do an IPO, which we should remember is also in principle a round of funding, regardless of its de facto purpose. But that, if not beyond the bounds of possibility, is beyond the scope of this article.Deals Fall ThroughAnyone who&rsquo;s been through a startup will find the preceding portrait to be missing something: disasters. If there&rsquo;s one thing all startups have in common, it&rsquo;s that something is always going wrong. And nowhere more than in matters of funding.For example, our hypothetical startup never spent more than half of one round before securing the next. That&rsquo;s more ideal than typical. Many startups—even successful ones—come close to running out of money at some point. Terrible things happen to startups when they run out of money, because they&rsquo;re designed for growth, not adversity.But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I&rsquo;ve described is that they all closed. In the startup world, closing is not what deals do. What deals do is fall through. If you&rsquo;re starting a startup you would do well to remember that. Birds fly; fish swim; deals fall through.Why? Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is that you lie to yourself. You want the deal to close, so you start to believe it will. But even correcting for this, startup deals fall through alarmingly often—far more often than, say, deals to buy real estate. The reason is that it&rsquo;s such a risky environment. People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked cases of buyer&rsquo;s remorse. They don&rsquo;t really grasp the risk they&rsquo;re taking till the deal&rsquo;s about to close. And then they panic. And not just inexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.So if you&rsquo;re a startup founder wondering why some angel investor isn&rsquo;t returning your phone calls, you can at least take comfort in the thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundred times the size.The example of a startup&rsquo;s history that I&rsquo;ve presented is like a skeleton—accurate so far as it goes, but needing to be fleshed out to be a complete picture. To get a complete picture, just add in every possible disaster.A frightening prospect? In a way. And yet also in a way encouraging. The very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone. People overvalue stability—especially young people, who ironically need it least. And so in starting a startup, as in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it gets you halfway there. On the day of the race, most of the other runners won&rsquo;t show up. Notes[1] The aim of such regulations is to protect widows and orphans from crooked investment schemes; people with a million dollars in liquid assets are assumed to be able to protect themselves. The unintended consequence is that the investments that generate the highest returns, like hedge funds, are available only to the rich.[2] Consulting is where product companies go to die. IBM is the most famous example. So starting as a consulting company is like starting out in the grave and trying to work your way up into the world of the living.[3] If &ldquo;near you&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean the Bay Area, Boston, or Seattle, consider moving. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence you haven&rsquo;t heard of many startups from Philadelphia.[4] Investors are often compared to sheep. And they are like sheep, but that&rsquo;s a rational response to their situation. Sheep act the way they do for a reason. If all the other sheep head for a certain field, it&rsquo;s probably good grazing. And when a wolf appears, is he going to eat a sheep in the middle of the flock, or one near the edge?[5] This was partly confidence, and partly simple ignorance. We didn&rsquo;t know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones. We thought software was all that mattered. But that turned out to be the right direction to be naive in: it&rsquo;s much better to overestimate than underestimate the importance of making a good product.[6] I&rsquo;ve omitted one source: government grants. I don&rsquo;t think these are even worth thinking about for the average startup. Governments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage startups, but what they give with one hand they take away with the other: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the restrictions on what you can do with the money so burdensome, that it would be easier to take a job to get the money. You should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some kind of social engineering&ndash; e.g. to encourage more startups to be started in Mississippi. Free money to start a startup in a place where few succeed is hardly free.Some government agencies run venture funding groups, which make investments rather than giving grants. For example, the CIA runs a venture fund called In-Q-Tel that is modelled on private sector funds and apparently generates good returns. They would probably be worth approaching—if you don&rsquo;t mind taking money from the CIA.[7] Options have largely been replaced with restricted stock, which amounts to the same thing. Instead of earning the right to buy stock, the employee gets the stock up front, and earns the right not to have to give it back. The shares set aside for this purpose are still called the &ldquo;option pool.&quot;[8] First-rate technical people do not generally hire themselves out to do due diligence for VCs. So the most difficult part for startup founders is often responding politely to the inane questions of the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; they send to look you over.[9] VCs regularly wipe out angels by issuing arbitrary amounts of new stock. They seem to have a standard piece of casuistry for this situation: that the angels are no longer working to help the company, and so don&rsquo;t deserve to keep their stock. This of course reflects a willful misunderstanding of what investment means; like any investor, the angel is being compensated for risks he took earlier. By a similar logic, one could argue that the VCs should be deprived of their shares when the company goes public.[10] One new thing the company might encounter is a down round, or a funding round at valuation lower than the previous round. Down rounds are bad news; it is generally the common stock holders who take the hit. Some of the most fearsome provisions in VC deal terms have to do with down rounds—like &ldquo;full ratchet anti-dilution,&rdquo; which is as frightening as it sounds.Founders are tempted to ignore these clauses, because they think the company will either be a big success or a complete bust. VCs know otherwise: it&rsquo;s not uncommon for startups to have moments of adversity before they ultimately succeed. So it&rsquo;s worth negotiating anti-dilution provisions, even though you don&rsquo;t think you need to, and VCs will try to make you feel that you&rsquo;re being gratuitously troublesome.Thanks to Sam Altman, Hutch Fishman, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Sesha Pratap, Stan Reiss, Andy Singleton, Zak Stone, and Aaron Swartz for reading drafts of this.Arabic Translation</p>

<p>Why to Move to a Startup Hub October 2007After the last talk I gave, one of the organizers got up on the stage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal. That never happened before. I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they moved to Silicon Valley.This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to be from the UK. So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley seemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling them that if they wanted to do things right they should all just move to America.Actually I&rsquo;m less American than I seem. I didn&rsquo;t say so, but I&rsquo;m British by birth. And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell Jewish jokes, I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to bother being diplomatic with a British audience.The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is not even a nationalistic one. [1] It&rsquo;s the same thing I say to startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every 6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to move to Silicon Valley. If that&rsquo;s true of Boston, it&rsquo;s even more true of every other city.This is about cities, not countries.And I think I can prove I&rsquo;m right. You can easily reduce the opposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum. Few would be willing to claim that it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all where a startup is—that a startup operating out of a small agricultural town wouldn&rsquo;t benefit from moving to a startup hub. Most people could see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to make them work, and other people trying to do it. And yet whatever argument you use to prove that startups don&rsquo;t need to move from London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups don&rsquo;t need to move from smaller towns to London.The difference between cities is a matter of degree. And if, as nearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon Valley than Boston, then they&rsquo;re better off in Silicon Valley than everywhere else too.I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion, because startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator. But the American startups we&rsquo;ve funded will attest that I say the same thing to them.I&rsquo;m not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon Valley to succeed. Just that all other things being equal, the more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there. But other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving. I&rsquo;m not saying founders with families should uproot them to move halfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put. Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some reason it seems to consume all your attention. A startup can&rsquo;t afford much of that. One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6 months working on moving to the US. Eventually they just gave up, because they couldn&rsquo;t afford to take so much time away from working on their software.(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley, the single best thing they could do might be to create a special visa for startup founders. US immigration policy is one of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s biggest weaknesses.)If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be better off in one of its centers. A startup doing something related to entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund you if you stay where you are, you should probably stay. Finding investors is hard. You generally shouldn&rsquo;t pass up a definite funding offer to move. [2]In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of startup hubs. Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive than Boston ones. Over and over, I&rsquo;ve seen startups we&rsquo;ve funded snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston investors who saw them first but acted too slowly. At this year&rsquo;s Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year, so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer. And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years. By the time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone.Boston investors will admit they&rsquo;re more conservative. Some want to believe this comes from the city&rsquo;s prudent Yankee character. But Occam&rsquo;s razor suggests the truth is less flattering. Boston investors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors for the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than Boston ones. They don&rsquo;t understand startups as well.West coast investors aren&rsquo;t bolder because they&rsquo;re irresponsible cowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic. They&rsquo;re bolder because they know what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re the skiers who ski on the diamond slopes. Boldness is the essence of venture investing. The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid losses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And the big hits often look risky at first.Like Facebook. Facebook was started in Boston. Boston VCs had the first shot at them. But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon Valley and raised money there. The partner who turned them down now says that &ldquo;may turn out to have been a mistake.&ldquo;Empirically, boldness wins. If the aggressive ways of west coast investors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long time coming. Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since the 1970s. If there was going to be a comeuppance for the west coast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it. But since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to act boldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinks east coast investors act that way out of prudence should see the frantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing a deal to a west coast one.In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization, startup hubs are also markets. And markets are usually centralized. Even now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a few cities. It&rsquo;s hard to say exactly what it is about face to face contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn&rsquo;t yet been duplicated by technology.Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhear five different people talking on the phone about deals. In fact, this is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time: it&rsquo;s hard to stand that year round. But though it can sometimes be annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about one thing, it&rsquo;s the place to be if that one thing is what you&rsquo;re trying to do.I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google. He knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position to compare the two companies. I asked him why Google was better at search. He said it wasn&rsquo;t anything specific Google did, but simply that they understood search so much better.And that&rsquo;s why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley. Startups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamond cutting. And in startup hubs they understand it. Notes[1] The nationalistic idea is the converse: that startups should stay in a certain city because of the country it&rsquo;s in. If you really have a &ldquo;one world&rdquo; viewpoint, deciding to move from London to Silicon Valley is no different from deciding to move from Chicago to Silicon Valley.[2] An investor who merely seems like he will fund you, however, you can ignore. Seeming like they will fund you one day is the way investors say No.Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Harjeet Taggar, and Kulveer Taggar for reading drafts of this.

<p>How to Get Startup Ideas Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. November 2012The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It&rsquo;s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they&rsquo;re something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way. ProblemsWhy is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.I made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online. But galleries didn&rsquo;t want to be online. It&rsquo;s not how the art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on this stupid idea? Because I didn&rsquo;t pay attention to users. I invented a model of the world that didn&rsquo;t correspond to reality, and worked from that. I didn&rsquo;t notice my model was wrong until I tried to convince users to pay for what we&rsquo;d built. Even then I took embarrassingly long to catch on. I was attached to my model of the world, and I&rsquo;d spent a lot of time on the software. They had to want it!Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn&rsquo;t merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.At YC we call these &ldquo;made-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;sitcom&rdquo; startup ideas. Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It&rsquo;s not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad.For example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn&rsquo;t sound obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. Surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users. You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features. [1]The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I would never use this.&rdquo; They say &ldquo;Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.&rdquo; Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don&rsquo;t want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. [2] WellWhen a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they&rsquo;re making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you&rsquo;re making and whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can&rsquo;t expect to excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole that&rsquo;s broad but shallow, or one that&rsquo;s narrow and deep, like a well.Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic. There were only a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. Thirty years later Facebook had the same shape. Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users wanted it a lot.When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they&rsquo;ll use it even when it&rsquo;s a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they&rsquo;ve never heard of? If you can&rsquo;t answer that, the idea is probably bad. [3]You don&rsquo;t need the narrowness of the well per se. It&rsquo;s depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed). But you almost always do get it. In practice the link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it&rsquo;s a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition for a good startup idea, it&rsquo;s not a sufficient one. If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea. Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of. Colleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges. Once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting them in.Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other machines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems; applications; IPO. SelfHow do you tell whether there&rsquo;s a path out of an idea? How do you tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a niche product? Often you can&rsquo;t. The founders of Airbnb didn&rsquo;t realize at first how big a market they were tapping. Initially they had a much narrower idea. They were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions. They didn&rsquo;t foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually. All they knew at first is that they were onto something. That&rsquo;s probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.Occasionally it&rsquo;s obvious from the beginning when there&rsquo;s a path out of the initial niche. And sometimes I can see a path that&rsquo;s not immediately obvious; that&rsquo;s one of our specialties at YC. But there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much experience you have. The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard to see.So if you can&rsquo;t predict whether there&rsquo;s a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you&rsquo;re the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you&rsquo;re at the leading edge of a field that&rsquo;s changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you&rsquo;re more likely to be right.In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig says: You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It&rsquo;s easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally. I&rsquo;ve wondered about that passage since I read it in high school. I&rsquo;m not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically, but it fits this situation well. Empirically, the way to have good startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.Being at the leading edge of a field doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward. You can also be at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he used computers so much. If you&rsquo;d asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they&rsquo;d like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the Internet, they&rsquo;d have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived online; to him it seemed natural.Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field &ldquo;live in the future.&rdquo; Combine that with Pirsig and you get: Live in the future, then build what&rsquo;s missing. That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas, it&rsquo;s generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind. Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think &ldquo;I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.&rdquo; Drew Houston realizes he&rsquo;s forgotten his USB stick and thinks &ldquo;I really need to make my files live online.&rdquo; Lots of people heard about the Altair. Lots forgot USB sticks. The reason those stimuli caused those founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented.The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not &ldquo;think up&rdquo; but &ldquo;notice.&rdquo; At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders&rsquo; own experiences &ldquo;organic&rdquo; startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.That may not have been what you wanted to hear. You may have expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I&rsquo;m telling you that the key is to have a mind that&rsquo;s prepared in the right way. But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth. And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend.If you&rsquo;re not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year&rsquo;s preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you&rsquo;re also looking for a cofounder. [4]You don&rsquo;t have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that&rsquo;s changing fast. Other domains change fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run.Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you&rsquo;ll be able to implement them. That&rsquo;s not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn&rsquo;t) but it&rsquo;s an advantage. It&rsquo;s a big advantage, when you&rsquo;re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting idea,&rdquo; you can think instead &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting idea. I&rsquo;ll try building an initial version tonight.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s even better when you&rsquo;re both a programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head. NoticingOnce you&rsquo;re living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing. If you&rsquo;re really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are obviously missing. What won&rsquo;t be obvious is that they&rsquo;re startup ideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don&rsquo;t merely turn on the filter &ldquo;What&rsquo;s missing?&rdquo; Also turn off every other filter, particularly &ldquo;Could this be a big company?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s plenty of time to apply that test later. But if you&rsquo;re thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.Most things that are missing will take some time to see. You almost have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.But you know the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer. It&rsquo;s impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops. You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you think &ldquo;What did I do before x?&ldquo;And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted. Even the most radically open-minded of us mostly do that. You couldn&rsquo;t get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.But if you&rsquo;re looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to question things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you get a lot of email, or because it&rsquo;s hard to get email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much email? What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways to solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails around after you&rsquo;ve read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that?Pay particular attention to things that chafe you. The advantage of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life (locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable. If you knew about all the things we&rsquo;ll get in the next 50 years but don&rsquo;t have yet, you&rsquo;d find present day life pretty constraining, just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50 years in a time machine. When something annoys you, it could be because you&rsquo;re living in the future.When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as obvious, at least to you. When we started Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers making individual HTML pages. It was obvious to us as programmers that these sites would have to be generated by software. [5]Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious. That suggests how weird this process is: you&rsquo;re trying to see things that are obvious, and yet that you hadn&rsquo;t seen.Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the problem — i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas. The best plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be missing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies. [6]Give yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it. If Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month, what if they&rsquo;d chosen a month before the Altair appeared? They probably would have worked on a less promising idea. Drew Houston did work on a less promising idea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup. But Dropbox was a much better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his skills. [7]A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they&rsquo;d be cool. If you do that, you&rsquo;ll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn&rsquo;t seem as interesting to build something that already existed.Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as &ldquo;toys&rdquo; often produces good ones. When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important. It&rsquo;s cool; users love it; it just doesn&rsquo;t matter. But if you&rsquo;re living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft started working on them. I&rsquo;m old enough to remember that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers was &ldquo;hobbyists.&rdquo; BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science project. The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another.At YC we&rsquo;re excited when we meet startups working on things that we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys. To us that&rsquo;s positive evidence an idea is good.If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can&rsquo;t afford not to), you can turn &ldquo;Live in the future and build what&rsquo;s missing&rdquo; into something even better: Live in the future and build what seems interesting. SchoolThat&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d advise college students to do, rather than trying to learn about &ldquo;entrepreneurship.&rdquo; &ldquo;Entrepreneurship&rdquo; is something you learn best by doing it. The examples of the most successful founders make that clear. What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future. College is an incomparable opportunity to do that. What a waste to sacrifice an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup — becoming the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas — by spending time learning about the easy part. Especially since you won&rsquo;t even really learn about it, any more than you&rsquo;d learn about sex in a class. All you&rsquo;ll learn is the words for things.The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about some other field, you&rsquo;ll probably see problems that software could solve. In fact, you&rsquo;re doubly likely to find good problems in another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their problems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don&rsquo;t even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.So if you&rsquo;re a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead of taking a class on entrepreneurship you&rsquo;re better off taking a class on, say, genetics. Or better still, go work for a biotech company. CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software companies. But if you want to find startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field. [8]Or don&rsquo;t take any extra classes, and just build things. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January. At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no classes to attend because they&rsquo;re supposed to be studying for finals. [9]But don&rsquo;t feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That&rsquo;s premature optimization. Just build things. Preferably with other students. It&rsquo;s not just the classes that make a university such a good place to crank oneself into the future. You&rsquo;re also surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing. If you work together with them on projects, you&rsquo;ll end up producing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that, empirically, is the best combination.Beware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it&rsquo;s quite likely to represent a good startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup. [10] I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research is so narrow that it&rsquo;s unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users&rsquo; problems. Whereas when students (or professors) build something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward solving users&rsquo; problems — perhaps even with an additional energy that comes from being freed from the constraints of research. CompetitionBecause a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you&rsquo;ll tend to feel that you&rsquo;re late. Don&rsquo;t let that deter you. Worrying that you&rsquo;re late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle the question. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you&rsquo;re probably not too late. It&rsquo;s exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don&rsquo;t discard the idea.If you&rsquo;re uncertain, ask users. The question of whether you&rsquo;re too late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs what you plan to make. If you have something that no competitor does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a beachhead. [11]The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more importantly, who&rsquo;s in it: if the beachhead consists of people doing something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it&rsquo;s probably big enough no matter how small it is. For example, if you&rsquo;re building something differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones, that&rsquo;s probably a big enough beachhead.Err on the side of doing things where you&rsquo;ll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.You don&rsquo;t need to worry about entering a &ldquo;crowded market&rdquo; so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that&rsquo;s a very promising starting point. Google was that type of idea. Your thesis has to be more precise than &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to make an x that doesn&rsquo;t suck&rdquo; though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn&rsquo;t have the courage of their convictions, and that your plan is what they&rsquo;d have done if they&rsquo;d followed through on their own insights. Google was that type of idea too. The search engines that preceded them shied away from the most radical implications of what they were doing — particularly that the better a job they did, the faster users would leave.A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both that there&rsquo;s demand and that none of the existing solutions are good enough. A startup can&rsquo;t hope to enter a market that&rsquo;s obviously big and yet in which they have no competitors. So any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft). [12] FiltersThere are two more filters you&rsquo;ll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay them lots of money. They&rsquo;d prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world. Which is a reasonable preference, because such things slow you down. But this preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you&rsquo;ll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay about the condition it induces, which I called schlep blindness. I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is. Thousands of programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands of programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before Stripe. But when they looked for startup ideas they didn&rsquo;t see this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal with payments. And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe, but not an intolerable one. In fact they might have had net less pain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition. They didn&rsquo;t have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users, because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear. We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting things about the architecture of our software, but we weren&rsquo;t interested in ecommerce per se. We could see the problem was one that needed to be solved though.Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a worse form of self-indulgence. Starting a successful startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what. Even if the product doesn&rsquo;t entail a lot of schleps, you&rsquo;ll still have plenty dealing with investors, hiring and firing people, and so on. So if there&rsquo;s some idea you think would be cool but you&rsquo;re kept away from by fear of the schleps involved, don&rsquo;t worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely useless as the schlep filter. If you&rsquo;re at the leading edge of a field that&rsquo;s changing rapidly, your ideas about what&rsquo;s sexy will be somewhat correlated with what&rsquo;s valuable in practice. Particularly as you get older and more experienced. Plus if you find an idea sexy, you&rsquo;ll work on it more enthusiastically. [13] RecipesWhile the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them and then build whatever interests you, sometimes you don&rsquo;t have that luxury. Sometimes you need an idea now. For example, if you&rsquo;re working on a startup and your initial idea turns out to be bad.For the rest of this essay I&rsquo;ll talk about tricks for coming up with startup ideas on demand. Although empirically you&rsquo;re better off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You just have to be more disciplined. When you use the organic method, you don&rsquo;t even notice an idea unless it&rsquo;s evidence that something is truly missing. But when you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with self-discipline. You&rsquo;ll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad, so you need to be able to filter them.One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the example of the organic method. Organic ideas feel like inspirations. There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but &ldquo;just knew&rdquo; it was promising. When you feel that about an idea you&rsquo;ve had while trying to come up with startup ideas, you&rsquo;re probably mistaken.When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise. If you&rsquo;re a database expert, don&rsquo;t build a chat app for teenagers (unless you&rsquo;re also a teenager). Maybe it&rsquo;s a good idea, but you can&rsquo;t trust your judgment about that, so ignore it. There have to be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can judge. Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving databases? That&rsquo;s because your expertise raises your standards. Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you&rsquo;re giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.The place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things you need. [14]One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t someone make x? If someone made x we&rsquo;d buy it in a second.&rdquo; If you can think of any x people said that about, you probably have an idea. You know there&rsquo;s demand, and people don&rsquo;t say that about things that are impossible to build.More generally, try asking yourself whether there&rsquo;s something unusual about you that makes your needs different from most other people&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;re probably not the only one. It&rsquo;s especially good if you&rsquo;re different in a way people will increasingly be.If you&rsquo;re changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea you&rsquo;d previously been working on. Did you discover any needs while working on it? Several well-known startups began this way. Hotmail began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. [15]A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young. Some of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their teens and early twenties. And while young founders are at a disadvantage in some respects, they&rsquo;re the only ones who really understand their peers. It would have been very hard for someone who wasn&rsquo;t a college student to start Facebook. So if you&rsquo;re a young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends would like to do that current technology won&rsquo;t let you?The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world. What&rsquo;s missing? What would they like to do that they can&rsquo;t? What&rsquo;s tedious or annoying, particularly in their work? Let the conversation get general; don&rsquo;t be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You&rsquo;re just looking for something to spark a thought. Maybe you&rsquo;ll notice a problem they didn&rsquo;t consciously realize they had, because you know how to solve it.When you find an unmet need that isn&rsquo;t your own, it may be somewhat blurry at first. The person who needs something may not know exactly what they need. In that case I often recommend that founders act like consultants — that they do what they&rsquo;d do if they&rsquo;d been retained to solve the problems of this one user. People&rsquo;s problems are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will be reusable, and whatever isn&rsquo;t will be a small price to start out certain that you&rsquo;ve reached the bottom of the well. [16]One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people&rsquo;s problems is to make them your own. When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn how restaurants worked. That may seem like taking things to extremes, but startups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps. Don&rsquo;t try to start Twitter. Those ideas are so rare that you can&rsquo;t find them by looking for them. Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries, it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their demise. For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment. But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism. What sort of company might cause people in the future to say &ldquo;this replaced journalism&rdquo; on some axis?But imagine asking that in the future, not now. When one company or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side. So don&rsquo;t look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs. Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has already started to be on most).When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore. It&rsquo;s particularly good if there&rsquo;s an admixture of disdain in the big players&rsquo; attitude, because that often misleads them. For example, after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option to produce it. Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which seemed intolerably déclassé to a high-end hardware company like HP was at the time. [17]Are there groups of scruffy but sophisticated users like the early microcomputer &ldquo;hobbyists&rdquo; that are currently being ignored by the big players? A startup with its sights set on bigger things can often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that wouldn&rsquo;t be justified by that market alone.Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them. The prices of gene sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore&rsquo;s Law-like declines. What new things will we be able to do in the new world we&rsquo;ll have in a few years? What are we unconsciously ruling out as impossible that will soon be possible? OrganicBut talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas. Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method. If you&rsquo;re at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don&rsquo;t have to look for waves; you are the wave.Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that&rsquo;s why most people who try fail so miserably. It doesn&rsquo;t work well simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible. The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing. And often these gaps won&rsquo;t seem to be ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to build. Which is why it&rsquo;s good to have the time and the inclination to build things just because they&rsquo;re interesting.Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that&rsquo;s the real recipe. Notes[1] This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web. It was common in the 1990s, except then people who had it used to say they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network for x. Structurally the idea is stone soup: you post a sign saying &ldquo;this is the place for people interested in x,&rdquo; and all those people show up and you make money from them. What lures founders into this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who might be interested in each type of x. What they forget is that any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard, and no one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.[2] I&rsquo;m not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social network for pet owners is a bad idea. I know it&rsquo;s a bad idea the way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism. The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don&rsquo;t even sound that plausible. So if all you know about a startup idea is that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it&rsquo;s bad.[3] More precisely, the users&rsquo; need has to give them sufficient activation energy to start using whatever you make, which can vary a lot. For example, the activation energy for enterprise software sold through traditional channels is very high, so you&rsquo;d have to be a lot better to get users to switch. Whereas the activation energy required to switch to a new search engine is low. Which in turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise software.[4] This gets harder as you get older. While the space of ideas doesn&rsquo;t have dangerous local maxima, the space of careers does. There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take through life, and the older you get, the higher the walls become.[5] It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big deal. Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but the programmers had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.[6] Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal, and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies you&rsquo;d noticed that day. Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and anomalies.[7] Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.There&rsquo;s comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them. Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas, because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the same ones.[8] For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs are the first phase of the recruiting funnel. But if you&rsquo;re good you can skip the first phase. If you&rsquo;re good you&rsquo;ll have no trouble getting hired by these companies when you graduate, regardless of how you spent your summers.[9] The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help their students start startups, the best thing they can do is leave them alone in the right way.[10] I&rsquo;m speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.[11] This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users, not competitors. The most important information about competitors is what you learn via users anyway.[12] In practice most successful startups have elements of both. And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting the boundaries of what you call the market. But it&rsquo;s useful to consider these two ideas separately.[13] I almost hesitate to raise that point though. Startups are businesses; the point of a business is to make money; and with that additional constraint, you can&rsquo;t expect you&rsquo;ll be able to spend all your time working on what interests you most.[14] The need has to be a strong one. You can retroactively describe any made-up idea as something you need. But do you really need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders &ldquo;Would you use this thing yourself, if you hadn&rsquo;t written it?&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d be surprised how often the answer is no.[15] Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad can be a source of better ideas:&ldquo;The best technique I&rsquo;ve found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody wants what they are building, they very often come back with a real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea.&quot;[16] Here&rsquo;s a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if you&rsquo;re college students. If you have a connection to one of the more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants, building anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that didn&rsquo;t already exist. Anything that got built this way would be very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding but also the perfect point to spread from.I have no idea whether this would work.[17] And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak started out by solving his own problems. He, like most of his peers, couldn&rsquo;t afford a monitor.Thanks to Sam Altman, Mike Arrington, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Garry Tan, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this, and Marc Andreessen, Joe Gebbia, Reid Hoffman, Shel Kaphan, Mike Moritz and Kevin Systrom for answering my questions about startup history.Japanese TranslationItalian TranslationSpanish Translation</p>

<p>The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn April 2006(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006 Startup School.)The startups we&rsquo;ve funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem quicker to learn some lessons than others. I think it&rsquo;s because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.We&rsquo;ve now invested in enough companies that I&rsquo;ve learned a trick for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones: they&rsquo;re the ones I have to keep repeating.So I&rsquo;m going to number these points, and maybe with future startups I&rsquo;ll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I&rsquo;ll make them all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I&rsquo;ll just be able to say: number four! 1. Release Early.The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users&rsquo; reactions.By &ldquo;release early&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean you should release something full of bugs, but that you should release something minimal. Users hate bugs, but they don&rsquo;t seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there&rsquo;s more coming soon.There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not. I&rsquo;ve been repeating that since 1993, and I haven&rsquo;t seen much since to contradict it. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick. [1]One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won&rsquo;t know your users. Reddit now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have no idea. No web startup does. And since you don&rsquo;t know your users, it&rsquo;s dangerous to guess what they&rsquo;ll like. Better to release something and let them tell you.Wufoo took this to heart and released their form-builder before the underlying database. You can&rsquo;t even drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat and hold the steering wheel. And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to. If they&rsquo;d waited to release everything at once, they wouldn&rsquo;t have discovered this problem till it was more deeply wired in.Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown cruise. If anything major is broken&ndash; if the idea&rsquo;s no good, for example, or the founders hate one another&ndash; the stress of getting that first version out will expose it. And if you have such problems you want to find them early.Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder. When you&rsquo;re working on something that isn&rsquo;t released, problems are intriguing. In something that&rsquo;s out there, problems are alarming. There is a lot more urgency once you release. And I think that&rsquo;s precisely why people put it off. They know they&rsquo;ll have to work a lot harder once they do. [2] 2. Keep Pumping Out Features.Of course, &ldquo;release early&rdquo; has a second component, without which it would be bad advice. If you&rsquo;re going to start with something that doesn&rsquo;t do much, you better improve it fast.What I find myself repeating is &ldquo;pump out features.&rdquo; And this rule isn&rsquo;t just for the initial stages. This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don&rsquo;t mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. By &ldquo;feature&rdquo; I mean one unit of hacking&ndash; one quantum of making users&rsquo; lives better.As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you&rsquo;ll probably feel like running tomorrow. But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you&rsquo;ll have. You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing. Users love a site that&rsquo;s constantly improving. In fact, users expect a site to improve. Imagine if you visited a site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and not one thing had changed. Wouldn&rsquo;t it start to seem lame? [3]They&rsquo;ll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them. If you&rsquo;re the rare exception&ndash; a company that actually listens&ndash; you&rsquo;ll generate fanatical loyalty. You won&rsquo;t need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it? I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are. Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens to have become its identity. For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.I think the solution is to assume that anything you&rsquo;ve made is far short of what it could be. Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. Ok, sure, what you have is perfect. But if you had to change something, what would it be?If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination. Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely. 3. Make Users Happy.Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make users happy. One thing all startups have in common is that they can&rsquo;t force anyone to do anything. They can&rsquo;t force anyone to use their software, and they can&rsquo;t force anyone to do deals with them. A startup has to sing for its supper. That&rsquo;s why the successful ones make great things. They have to, or die.When you&rsquo;re running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris blown about by powerful winds. The most powerful wind is users. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups. Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other. If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will catch.I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is. The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors. It&rsquo;s them you have to design your site for. The people who really care will find what they want by themselves.The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button. Think about your own experience: most links you follow lead to something lame. Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link. So your site has to say &ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t click on Back. This site isn&rsquo;t lame. Look at this, for example.&ldquo;There are two things you have to do to make people pause. The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about. How often have you visited a site that seemed to assume you already knew what they did? For example, the corporate site that says the company makes enterprise content management solutions for business that enable organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total cost of ownership. An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can. A startup should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does. [4] And not just to users. You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. You probably shouldn&rsquo;t even start a company to do something that can&rsquo;t be described compellingly in one or two sentences.The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you&rsquo;ve got, right away. If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that&rsquo;s the only one most visitors will see. Though indeed there&rsquo;s a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further. [5]In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by showing them. One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t say that a character&rsquo;s angry; have him grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half. Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it.The industry term here is &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo; The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users&ndash; whatever your definition of a user is. You can measure this in your growth rate. Either your site is catching on, or it isn&rsquo;t, and you must know which. If you have decent growth, you&rsquo;ll win in the end, no matter how obscure you are now. And if you don&rsquo;t, you need to fix something. 4. Fear the Right Things.Another thing I find myself saying a lot is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Actually, it&rsquo;s more often &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about this; worry about that instead.&rdquo; Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things.Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem. Disasters are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent that covers what you&rsquo;re doing, your servers keep crashing, you run into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name, a deal falls through&ndash; these are all par for the course. They won&rsquo;t kill you unless you let them.Nor will most competitors. A lot of startups worry &ldquo;what if Google builds something like us?&rdquo; Actually big companies are not the ones you have to worry about&ndash; not even Google. The people at Google are smart, but no smarter than you; they&rsquo;re not as motivated, because Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails; and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startups you don&rsquo;t know exist yet. They&rsquo;re way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they&rsquo;re cornered animals.Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security. You should compete against what someone else could be doing, not just what you can see people doing. A corollary is that you shouldn&rsquo;t relax just because you have no visible competitors yet. No matter what your idea, there&rsquo;s someone else out there working on the same thing.That&rsquo;s the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. More people are starting startups, but not as many more as could. Most college graduates still think they have to get a job. The average person can&rsquo;t ignore something that&rsquo;s been beaten into their head since they were three just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat. Way more startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors. There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users. Each is, by itself, enough to kill you. But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users. If you want a recipe for a startup that&rsquo;s going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to build, no matter what.Almost everyone&rsquo;s initial plan is broken. If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages, and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards. In both cases their customers told them what their business should be&ndash; and they were smart enough to listen.As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man. You&rsquo;ll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. This principle is very powerful. It&rsquo;s why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example. And it applies to startups too. No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam of users. 5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it&rsquo;s not what you might think. The most important quality in a startup founder is determination. Not intelligence&ndash; determination.This is a little depressing. I&rsquo;d like to believe Viaweb succeeded because we were smart, not merely determined. A lot of people in the startup world want to believe that. Not just founders, but investors too. They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence. And you can tell they really believe this, because it affects their investment decisions.Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors. This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research, but in software you want to invest in students, not professors. Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. What students lack in experience they more than make up in dedication.Of course, if you want to get rich, it&rsquo;s not enough merely to be determined. You have to be smart too, right? I&rsquo;d like to think so, but I&rsquo;ve had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent several years living in New York.You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won&rsquo;t kill you. But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and that will kill you very rapidly.Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it&rsquo;s possible, but it requires extraordinary effort. If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he&rsquo;d be very indignant. Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in addition to writing software ten times faster than you&rsquo;d ever had to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters. That&rsquo;s the part that really demands determination. In a startup, there&rsquo;s always some disaster happening. So if you&rsquo;re the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there&rsquo;s always one right there.But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit. Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you&rsquo;re ambivalent, they won&rsquo;t give you much attention. If you lack commitment, you&rsquo;ll just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not to you. If you lack commitment, it will seem to you that you&rsquo;re unlucky.Whereas if you&rsquo;re determined to stick around, people will pay attention to you, because odds are they&rsquo;ll have to deal with you later. You&rsquo;re a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come to terms with you.At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the attitude that they&rsquo;re going to give this startup thing a shot for three months, and if something great happens, they&rsquo;ll stick with it&ndash; &ldquo;something great&rdquo; meaning either that someone wants to buy them or invest millions of dollars in them. But if this is your attitude, &ldquo;something great&rdquo; is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.If an acquirer thinks you&rsquo;re going to stick around no matter what, they&rsquo;ll be more likely to buy you, because if they don&rsquo;t and you stick around, you&rsquo;ll probably grow, your price will go up, and they&rsquo;ll be left wishing they&rsquo;d bought you earlier. Ditto for investors. What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out. [6] So if you make it clear you&rsquo;re going to succeed no matter what, and the only reason you need them is to make it happen a little faster, you&rsquo;re much more likely to get money.You can&rsquo;t fake this. The only way to convince everyone that you&rsquo;re ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.You have to be the right kind of determined, though. I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup. You have to be determined, but flexible, like a running back. A successful running back doesn&rsquo;t just put his head down and try to run through people. He improvises: if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he&rsquo;ll even run in the wrong direction briefly if that will help. The one thing he&rsquo;ll never do is stand still. [7] 6. There Is Always Room.I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social component to their software. He said he didn&rsquo;t think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out. Really? So in a hundred years the only social networking sites will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us? Not likely.There is always room for new stuff. At every point in history, even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering things that made everyone say &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t anyone think of that before?&rdquo; We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the Facebook was founded&ndash; though strictly speaking someone else did think of that.The reason we don&rsquo;t see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are, and assume that&rsquo;s how things have to be. For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google. Surely that field, at least, is tapped out. Really? In a hundred years&ndash; or even twenty&ndash; are people still going to search for information using something like the current Google? Even Google probably doesn&rsquo;t think that.In particular, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any limit to the number of startups. Sometimes you hear people saying &ldquo;All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?&rdquo; That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it&rsquo;s mistaken. No one proposes that there&rsquo;s some limit to the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple thousand people each. Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each? It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard.The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get acquired by Google and Yahoo&ndash; though it seems even that should be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying&ndash; but the amount of wealth that can be created. And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any limit on that, except cosmological ones.So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups. Startups make wealth, which means they make things people want, and if there&rsquo;s a limit on the number of things people want, we are nowhere near it. I still don&rsquo;t even have a flying car. 7. Don&rsquo;t Get Your Hopes Up.This is another one I&rsquo;ve been repeating since long before Y Combinator. It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.Startup founders are naturally optimistic. They wouldn&rsquo;t do it otherwise. But you should treat your optimism the way you&rsquo;d treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that&rsquo;s also very dangerous. You have to build a shield around it, or it will fry you.The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be useless if it were. It&rsquo;s pierced in a few places to let pipes in. An optimism shield has to be pierced too. I think the place to draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you expect of other people. It&rsquo;s ok to be optimistic about what you can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to be pushing the limits of whatever you&rsquo;re doing. So things don&rsquo;t happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the world. Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals. If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it&rsquo;s not going to happen. The VCs who say they&rsquo;re going to invest in you aren&rsquo;t. The company that says they&rsquo;re going to buy you isn&rsquo;t. The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won&rsquo;t. Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being disappointed when things fall through. It&rsquo;s for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their company against something that&rsquo;s going to fall over, taking them with it.For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there&rsquo;s a natural tendency to stop looking for other investors. That&rsquo;s why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking. And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a pain. Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink. So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you&rsquo;ll get better terms. Deals are dynamic; unless you&rsquo;re negotiating with someone unusually honest, there&rsquo;s not a single point where you shake hands and the deal&rsquo;s done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness&ndash; if they sense you need this deal&ndash; they will be very tempted to screw you in the details.VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators. They&rsquo;re trained to take advantage of weakness. [8] So while they&rsquo;re often nice guys, they just can&rsquo;t help it. And as pros they do this more than you. So don&rsquo;t even try to bluff them. The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it. And if you don&rsquo;t believe in a deal, you&rsquo;ll be less likely to depend on it.So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you hear someone say the words &ldquo;we want to invest in you&rdquo; or &ldquo;we want to acquire you,&rdquo; I want the following phrase to appear automatically in your head: don&rsquo;t get your hopes up. Just continue running your company as if this deal didn&rsquo;t exist. Nothing is more likely to make it close.The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face. Speed, not MoneyThe way I&rsquo;ve described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful. It is. When I talk to the founders of the companies we&rsquo;ve funded, they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn&rsquo;t realize it would be this hard.So why do it? It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money? Is making money really that important?No, not really. It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously. I regard making money as a boring errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible. There is nothing grand or heroic about starting a startup per se.So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups? I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich, but as a way to work faster. You have to make a living, and a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it drag on through your whole life. [9]We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairly miraculous. It is also palpably short. You&rsquo;re given this marvellous thing, and then poof, it&rsquo;s taken away. You can see why people invent gods to explain it. But even to people who don&rsquo;t believe in gods, life commands respect. There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious. As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don&rsquo;t waste time, because time is what life is made of.So no, there&rsquo;s nothing particularly grand about making money. That&rsquo;s not what makes startups worth the trouble. What&rsquo;s important about startups is the speed. By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect for life, and there is something grand about that.Notes[1] Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs, and not fixing them fast enough, but I don&rsquo;t know of any that died from releasing something stable but minimal very early, then promptly improving it.[2] I know this is why I haven&rsquo;t released Arc. The moment I do, I&rsquo;ll have people nagging me for features.[3] A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application in this respect. Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames. Of the two, I&rsquo;d say the rate of improvement is more important to users than where you currently are.[4] It should not always tell this to users, however. For example, MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats. But it was wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.[5] Similarly, don&rsquo;t make users register to try your site. Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register to get at it. But they&rsquo;ve been trained to expect the opposite. Most of the things they&rsquo;ve tried on the web have sucked&ndash; and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. They don&rsquo;t make their money (if they make money) off their median investments. In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate mediocre returns, and one or two &ldquo;make the fund&rdquo; by succeeding spectacularly. So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.[7] The attitude of a running back doesn&rsquo;t translate to soccer. Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders, a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the long term than one who passes.[8] The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations is that we&rsquo;re not professional negotiators, and don&rsquo;t want to turn into them.[9] There are two ways to do work you love: (a) to make money, then work on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on stuff you love.

<p>The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. October 2006In the Q &amp; A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made startups fail. After standing there gaping for a few seconds I realized this was kind of a trick question. It&rsquo;s equivalent to asking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause of failure, you succeed — and that&rsquo;s too big a question to answer on the fly.Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem from this direction. If you have a list of all the things you shouldn&rsquo;t do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just by negating. And this form of list may be more useful in practice. It&rsquo;s easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn&rsquo;t than always to remember to do something you should. [1]In a sense there&rsquo;s just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you make something users want, you&rsquo;ll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don&rsquo;t do. And if you don&rsquo;t make something users want, then you&rsquo;re dead, whatever else you do or don&rsquo;t do. So really this is a list of 18 things that cause startups not to make something users want. Nearly all failure funnels through that.1. Single FounderHave you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person? Even companies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.What&rsquo;s wrong with having one founder? To start with, it&rsquo;s a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn&rsquo;t talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That&rsquo;s pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.But even if the founder&rsquo;s friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he&rsquo;s still at a disadvantage. Starting a startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.The last one might be the most important. The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone. When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws. Each thinks &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let my friends down.&rdquo; This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it&rsquo;s missing when there&rsquo;s just one founder.2. Bad LocationStartups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After that there&rsquo;s not much. Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley. In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it&rsquo;s too small to measure.Why is the falloff so sharp? Probably for the same reason it is in other industries. What&rsquo;s the sixth largest fashion center in the US? The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing? Whatever they are they&rsquo;re probably so far from the top that it would be misleading even to call them centers.It&rsquo;s an interesting question why cities become startup hubs, but the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is for any industry: that&rsquo;s where the experts are. Standards are higher; people are more sympathetic to what you&rsquo;re doing; the kind of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the same business. Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it&rsquo;s clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.3. Marginal NicheMost of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding competition.If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a certain age they&rsquo;re afraid of the ball. When the ball comes near them their instinct is to avoid it. I didn&rsquo;t make a lot of catches as an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of catching it.Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight year old strategy for dealing with fly balls. If you make anything good, you&rsquo;re going to have competitors, so you may as well face that. You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious. It&rsquo;s not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue smaller ones because they seem safer. Your unconscious won&rsquo;t even let you think of grand ideas. So the solution may be to think about ideas without involving yourself. What would be a great idea for someone else to do as a startup?4. Derivative IdeaMany of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company. That&rsquo;s one source of ideas, but not the best. If you look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in imitation of some other startup. Where did they get their ideas? Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.Our startup made software for making online stores. When we started it, there wasn&rsquo;t any; the few sites you could order from were hand-made at great expense by web consultants. We knew that if online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated by software, so we wrote some. Pretty straightforward.It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you personally. Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer, Google because Larry and Sergey couldn&rsquo;t find stuff online, Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn&rsquo;t exchange email at work.So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction. Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might solve them. [2] What do people complain about? What do you wish there was?5. ObstinacyIn some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you encounter. Starting startups is not one of them. The stick-to-your-vision approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal, where the problem is well-defined. Startups are more like science, where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.So don&rsquo;t get too attached to your original plan, because it&rsquo;s probably wrong. Most successful startups end up doing something different than they originally intended — often so different that it doesn&rsquo;t even seem like the same company. You have to be prepared to see the better idea when it arrives. And the hardest part of that is often discarding your old idea.But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right. Switching to a new idea every week will be equally fatal. Is there some kind of external test you can use? One is to ask whether the ideas represent some kind of progression. If in each new idea you&rsquo;re able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then you&rsquo;re probably in a process that converges. Whereas if you keep restarting from scratch, that&rsquo;s a bad sign.Fortunately there&rsquo;s someone you can ask for advice: your users. If you&rsquo;re thinking about turning in some new direction and your users seem excited about it, it&rsquo;s probably a good bet.6. Hiring Bad ProgrammersI forgot to include this in the early versions of the list, because nearly all the founders I know are programmers. This is not a serious problem for them. They might accidentally hire someone bad, but it&rsquo;s not going to kill the company. In a pinch they can do whatever&rsquo;s required themselves.But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers. A lot of those companies were started by business guys who thought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired programmers to implement it. That&rsquo;s actually much harder than it sounds — almost impossibly hard in fact — because business guys can&rsquo;t tell which are the good programmers. They don&rsquo;t even get a shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job implementing the vision of a business guy.In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that he&rsquo;s a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren&rsquo;t. Then they&rsquo;re mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters. This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company, but without the advantages.So how do you pick good programmers if you&rsquo;re not a programmer? I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an answer. I was about to say you&rsquo;d have to find a good programmer to help you hire people. But if you can&rsquo;t recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?7. Choosing the Wrong PlatformA related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers) is choosing the wrong platform. For example, I think a lot of startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build server-based applications on Windows. Hotmail was still running on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because Windows couldn&rsquo;t handle the load. If Hotmail&rsquo;s founders had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.PayPal only just dodged this bullet. After they merged with X.com, the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounder Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on Windows as Unix. Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.Platform is a vague word. It could mean an operating system, or a programming language, or a &ldquo;framework&rdquo; built on top of a programming language. It implies something that both supports and limits, like the foundation of a house.The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that seem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, like Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them. Java applets were probably the most spectacular example. This was supposed to be the new way of delivering applications. Presumably it killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.How do you pick the right platforms? The usual way is to hire good programmers and let them choose. But there is a trick you could use if you&rsquo;re not a programmer: visit a top computer science department and see what they use in research projects.8. Slowness in LaunchingCompanies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done. It&rsquo;s intrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done. It takes an effort of will to push through this and get something released to users. [3]Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch. Most are equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday life. There&rsquo;s something that needs to happen first. Maybe. But if the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push of a button, would they still be waiting?One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually finish some quantum of work. Nothing is truly finished till it&rsquo;s released; you can see that from the rush of work that&rsquo;s always involved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought it was. The other reason you need to launch is that it&rsquo;s only by bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching: working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too many different things; excessive perfectionism. Fortunately you can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself to launch something fairly quickly.9. Launching Too EarlyLaunching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more startups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch too fast. The danger here is that you ruin your reputation. You launch something, the early adopters try it out, and if it&rsquo;s no good they may never come back.So what&rsquo;s the minimum you need to launch? We suggest startups think about what they plan to do, identify a core that&rsquo;s both (a) useful on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded into the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for writing software. Think about the overall goal, then start by writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful. If it&rsquo;s a subset, you&rsquo;ll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case you won&rsquo;t be wasting your time. But more likely you&rsquo;ll find that implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you see more clearly what the rest should do.The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant. They don&rsquo;t expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just has to do something.10. Having No Specific User in MindYou can&rsquo;t build things users like without understanding them. I mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how well you understand the problem you&rsquo;re solving, and the problems you understand best are your own. [4]That&rsquo;s just a theory. What&rsquo;s not a theory is the converse: if you&rsquo;re trying to solve problems you don&rsquo;t understand, you&rsquo;re hosed.And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to assume that someone, they&rsquo;re not sure exactly who, will want what they&rsquo;re building. Do the founders want it? No, they&rsquo;re not the target market. Who is? Teenagers. People interested in local events (that one is a perennial tarpit). Or &ldquo;business&rdquo; users. What business users? Gas stations? Movie studios? Defense contractors?You can of course build something for users other than yourself. We did. But you should realize you&rsquo;re stepping into dangerous territory. You&rsquo;re flying on instruments, in effect, so you should (a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the instruments.In this case the instruments are the users. When designing for other people you have to be empirical. You can no longer guess what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses. So if you&rsquo;re going to make something for teenagers or &ldquo;business&rdquo; users or some other group that doesn&rsquo;t include you, you have to be able to talk some specific ones into using what you&rsquo;re making. If you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re on the wrong track.11. Raising Too Little MoneyMost successful startups take funding at some point. Like having more than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically. How much should you take, though?Startup funding is measured in time. Every startup that isn&rsquo;t profitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certain amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop. This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in &ldquo;How much runway do you have left?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a good metaphor because it reminds you that when the money runs out you&rsquo;re going to be airborne or dead.Too little money means not enough to get airborne. What airborne means depends on the situation. Usually you have to advance to a visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype; if you have a prototype, launching; if you&rsquo;re launched, significant growth. It depends on investors, because until you&rsquo;re profitable that&rsquo;s who you have to convince.So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get to the next step, whatever that is. [5] Fortunately you have some control over both how much you spend and what the next step is. We advise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically nothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype. This gives you maximum flexibility.12. Spending Too MuchIt&rsquo;s hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little. If you run out of money, you could say either was the cause. The only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other startups. If you raised five million and ran out of money, you probably spent too much.Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be. Founders seem to have learned that lesson. Plus it keeps getting cheaper to start a startup. So as of this writing few startups spend too much. None of the ones we&rsquo;ve funded have. (And not just because we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further rounds.)The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people. This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows you down—so money that&rsquo;s getting consumed faster has to last longer. Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks explained it in The Mythical Man-Month.We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don&rsquo;t do it if you can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary, not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who are committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who are either going to write code or go out and get users, because those are the only things you need at first.13. Raising Too Much MoneyIt&rsquo;s obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such a thing as having too much?Yes and no. The problem is not so much the money itself as what comes with it. As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, &ldquo;Once you take several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking.&rdquo; If VCs fund you, they&rsquo;re not going to let you just put the money in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen. They want that money to go to work. [6] At the very least you&rsquo;ll move into proper office space and hire more people. That will change the atmosphere, and not entirely for the better. Now most of your people will be employees rather than founders. They won&rsquo;t be as committed; they&rsquo;ll need to be told what to do; they&rsquo;ll start to engage in office politics.When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs and has kids.Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets harder to change direction. Suppose your initial plan was to sell something to companies. After taking VC money you hire a sales force to do that. What happens now if you realize you should be making this for consumers instead of businesses? That&rsquo;s a completely different kind of selling. What happens, in practice, is that you don&rsquo;t realize that. The more people you have, the more you stay pointed in the same direction.Another drawback of large investments is the time they take. The time required to raise money grows with the amount. [7] When the amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious. VCs never quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently endless conversation. Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge time sink — more work, probably, than the startup itself. And you don&rsquo;t want to be spending all your time talking to investors while your competitors are spending theirs building things.We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first reasonable deal they get. If you get an offer from a reputable firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms, just take it and get on with building the company. [8] Who cares if you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere? Economically, startups are an all-or-nothing game. Bargain-hunting among investors is a waste of time.14. Poor Investor ManagementAs a founder, you have to manage your investors. You shouldn&rsquo;t ignore them, because they may have useful insights. But neither should you let them run the company. That&rsquo;s supposed to be your job. If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies they fund, why didn&rsquo;t they start them?Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous than caving in to them. In our startup, we erred on the ignoring side. A lot of our energy got drained away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product. But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have destroyed the company. If the founders know what they&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s better to have half their attention focused on the product than the full attention of investors who don&rsquo;t.How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on how much money you&rsquo;ve taken. When you raise VC-scale money, the investors get a great deal of control. If they have a board majority, they&rsquo;re literally your bosses. In the more common case, where founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding vote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors have to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.If things go well, this shouldn&rsquo;t matter. So long as you seem to be advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone. But things don&rsquo;t always go smoothly in startups. Investors have made trouble even for the most successful companies. One of the most famous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder in firing Steve Jobs. Apparently even Google got a lot of grief from their investors early on.15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) ProfitWhen I said at the beginning that if you make something users want, you&rsquo;ll be fine, you may have noticed I didn&rsquo;t mention anything about having the right business model. That&rsquo;s not because making money is unimportant. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that founders start companies with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before they tank. The reason we tell founders not to worry about the business model initially is that making something people want is so much harder.I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s so hard to make something people want. It seems like it should be straightforward. But you can tell it must be hard by how few startups do it.Because making something people want is so much harder than making money from it, you should leave business models for later, just as you&rsquo;d leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2. In version 1, solve the core problem. And the core problem in a startup is how to create wealth (= how much people want something x the number who want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.The companies that win are the ones that put users first. Google, for example. They made search work, then worried about how to make money from it. And yet some startup founders still think it&rsquo;s irresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning. They&rsquo;re often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes from less malleable industries.It is irresponsible not to think about business models. It&rsquo;s just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands DirtyNearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code and have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money from it. And not just the lazy ones. Larry and Sergey apparently felt this way too at first. After developing their new search algorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company to buy it.Start a company? Yech. Most hackers would rather just have ideas. But as Larry and Sergey found, there&rsquo;s not much of a market for ideas. No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and use that to grow a user base. Then they&rsquo;ll pay big time.Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much. There&rsquo;s nothing like users for convincing acquirers. It&rsquo;s not just that the risk is decreased. The acquirers are human, and they have a hard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for being clever. When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot of users, they can tell themselves they&rsquo;re buying the users rather than the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow. [9]If you&rsquo;re going to attract users, you&rsquo;ll probably have to get up from your computer and go find some. It&rsquo;s unpleasant work, but if you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of succeeding. In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their applications. But there was one who was away half the time talking to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals. Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker? [10] But it paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that group by an order of magnitude.If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you can&rsquo;t just hack. At least one hacker will have to spend some of the time doing business stuff.17. Fights Between FoundersFights between founders are surprisingly common. About 20% of the startups we&rsquo;ve funded have had a founder leave. It happens so often that we&rsquo;ve reversed our attitude to vesting. We still don&rsquo;t require it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly way for people to quit.A founder leaving doesn&rsquo;t necessarily kill a startup, though. Plenty of successful startups have had that happen. [11] Fortunately it&rsquo;s usually the least committed founder who leaves. If there are three founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal. If you have two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves, that&rsquo;s more of a problem. But even that is survivable. Blogger got down to one person, and they bounced back.Most of the disputes I&rsquo;ve seen between founders could have been avoided if they&rsquo;d been more careful about who they started a company with. Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people. Which means they&rsquo;re inevitable. And most founders who&rsquo;ve been burned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed, when they started the company. Don&rsquo;t suppress misgivings. It&rsquo;s much easier to fix problems before the company is started than after. So don&rsquo;t include your housemate in your startup because he&rsquo;d feel left out otherwise. Don&rsquo;t start a company with someone you dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you won&rsquo;t find anyone else. The people are the most important ingredient in a startup, so don&rsquo;t compromise there.18. A Half-Hearted EffortThe failed startups you hear most about are the spectacular flameouts. Those are actually the elite of failures. The most common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the one that doesn&rsquo;t do much of anything — the one we never even hear about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the side while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere and was gradually abandoned.Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the most important thing is to quit your day job. Most founders of failed startups don&rsquo;t quit their day jobs, and most founders of successful ones do. If startup failure were a disease, the CDC would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.Does that mean you should quit your day job? Not necessarily. I&rsquo;m guessing here, but I&rsquo;d guess that many of these would-be founders may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company, and that in the back of their minds, they know it. The reason they don&rsquo;t invest more time in their startup is that they know it&rsquo;s a bad investment. [12]I&rsquo;d also guess there&rsquo;s some band of people who could have succeeded if they&rsquo;d taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn&rsquo;t. I have no idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless progression has the sort of distribution you&rsquo;d expect, the number of people who could have made it, if they&rsquo;d quit their day job, is probably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make it. [13]If that&rsquo;s true, most startups that could succeed fail because the founders don&rsquo;t devote their whole efforts to them. That certainly accords with what I see out in the world. Most startups fail because they don&rsquo;t make something people want, and the reason most don&rsquo;t is that they don&rsquo;t try hard enough.In other words, starting startups is just like everything else. The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough. To the extent there&rsquo;s a secret to success, it&rsquo;s not to be in denial about that. Notes[1] This is not a complete list of the causes of failure, just those you can control. There are also several you can&rsquo;t, notably ineptitude and bad luck.[2] Ironically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a facebook exclusively for college students.[3] Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying &ldquo;Real artists ship.&rdquo; This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not true. Many famous works of art are unfinished. It&rsquo;s true in fields that have hard deadlines, like architecture and filmmaking, but even there people tend to be tweaking stuff till it&rsquo;s yanked out of their hands.[4] There&rsquo;s probably also a second factor: startup founders tend to be at the leading edge of technology, so problems they face are probably especially valuable.[5] You should take more than you think you&rsquo;ll need, maybe 50% to 100% more, because software takes longer to write and deals longer to close than you expect.[6] Since people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we&rsquo;re not. VCs invest large amounts of other people&rsquo;s money. We invest small amounts of our own, like angel investors.[7] Not linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five million dollars. In practice it just feels like it takes forever.Though if you include the cases where VCs don&rsquo;t invest, it would literally take forever in the median case. And maybe we should, because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that they take a long time. That&rsquo;s the best case. The real danger is that you&rsquo;ll expend a lot of time and get nothing.[8] Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see if you have the balls to ask for more. It&rsquo;s lame that VCs play such games, but some do. If you&rsquo;re dealing with one of those you should push back on the valuation a bit.[9] Suppose YouTube&rsquo;s founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told them &ldquo;Google Video is badly designed. Give us $10 million and we&rsquo;ll tell you all the mistakes you made.&rdquo; They would have gotten the royal raspberry. Eighteen months later Google paid $1.6 billion for the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves that they were buying a phenomenon, or a community, or some vague thing like that.I don&rsquo;t mean to be hard on Google. They did better than their competitors, who may have now missed the video boat entirely.[10] Yes, actually: dealing with the government. But phone companies are up there.[11] Many more than most people realize, because companies don&rsquo;t advertise this. Did you know Apple originally had three founders?[12] I&rsquo;m not dissing these people. I don&rsquo;t have the determination myself. I&rsquo;ve twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb, and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur of poverty I just wasn&rsquo;t willing to endure the stress of a startup.[13] So how do you know whether you&rsquo;re in the category of people who should quit their day job, or the presumably larger one who shouldn&rsquo;t? I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge for yourself and that you should seek outside advice, before realizing that that&rsquo;s what we do. We think of ourselves as investors, but viewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for advising people whether or not to quit their day job. We could be mistaken, and no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on our conclusions.Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Greg McAdoo, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.
