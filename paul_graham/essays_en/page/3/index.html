		<h1 id="stuff">Stuff</h1>
<p>Stuff July 2007I have too much stuff. Most people in America do. In fact, the poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have. Hardly anyone is so poor that they can&rsquo;t afford a front yard full of old cars.It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. Stuff used to be rare and valuable. You can still see evidence of that if you look for it. For example, in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms don&rsquo;t have closets. In those days people&rsquo;s stuff fit in a chest of drawers. Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot less stuff. When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I&rsquo;m surprised how empty houses look. As a kid I had what I thought was a huge fleet of toy cars, but they&rsquo;d be dwarfed by the number of toys my nephews have. All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about a third of the surface of my bed. In my nephews&rsquo; rooms the bed is the only clear space.Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven&rsquo;t changed correspondingly. We overvalue stuff.That was a big problem for me when I had no money. I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable, so almost instinctively I accumulated it. Friends would leave something behind when they moved, or I&rsquo;d see something as I was walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find yourself describing as &ldquo;perfectly good&rdquo;), or I&rsquo;d find something in almost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale. And pow, more stuff.In fact these free or nearly free things weren&rsquo;t bargains, because they were worth even less than they cost. Most of the stuff I accumulated was worthless, because I didn&rsquo;t need it.What I didn&rsquo;t understand was that the value of some new acquisition wasn&rsquo;t the difference between its retail price and what I paid for it. It was the value I derived from it. Stuff is an extremely illiquid asset. Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it&rsquo;s &ldquo;worth?&rdquo; The only way you&rsquo;re ever going to extract any value from it is to use it. And if you don&rsquo;t have any immediate use for it, you probably never will.Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think stuff is still valuable. But it would be closer to the truth to treat stuff as worthless.In fact, worse than worthless, because once you&rsquo;ve accumulated a certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other way around. I know of one couple who couldn&rsquo;t retire to the town they preferred because they couldn&rsquo;t afford a place there big enough for all their stuff. Their house isn&rsquo;t theirs; it&rsquo;s their stuff&rsquo;s.And unless you&rsquo;re extremely organized, a house full of stuff can be very depressing. A cluttered room saps one&rsquo;s spirits. One reason, obviously, is that there&rsquo;s less room for people in a room full of stuff. But there&rsquo;s more going on than that. I think humans constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what&rsquo;s around them. And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy you have left for conscious thoughts. A cluttered room is literally exhausting.(This could explain why clutter doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother kids as much as adults. Kids are less perceptive. They build a coarser model of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.)I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy for a year. All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff. The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady&rsquo;s attic back in the US. And you know what? All I missed were some of the books. By the end of the year I couldn&rsquo;t even remember what else I had stored in that attic.And yet when I got back I didn&rsquo;t discard so much as a box of it. Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone? I might need that one day.The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated all this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately needed on stuff that I didn&rsquo;t.Why would I do that? Because the people whose job is to sell you stuff are really, really good at it. The average 25 year old is no match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to get you to spend money on stuff. They make the experience of buying stuff so pleasant that &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; becomes a leisure activity.How do you protect yourself from these people? It can&rsquo;t be easy. I&rsquo;m a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well into my thirties. But one thing that might work is to ask yourself, before buying something, &ldquo;is this going to make my life noticeably better?&ldquo;A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking herself before she bought anything &ldquo;Am I going to wear this all the time?&rdquo; If she couldn&rsquo;t convince herself that something she was thinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore all the time, she wouldn&rsquo;t buy it. I think that would work for any kind of purchase. Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this be something I use constantly? Or is it just something nice? Or worse still, a mere bargain?The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don&rsquo;t use much because it&rsquo;s too good. Nothing owns you like fragile stuff. For example, the &ldquo;good china&rdquo; so many households have, and whose defining quality is not so much that it&rsquo;s fun to use, but that one must be especially careful not to break it.Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall cost of owning it. The purchase price is just the beginning. You&rsquo;re going to have to think about that thing for years—perhaps for the rest of your life. Every thing you own takes energy away from you. Some give more than they take. Those are the only things worth having.I&rsquo;ve now stopped accumulating stuff. Except books—but books are different. Books are more like a fluid than individual objects. It&rsquo;s not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books, whereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you&rsquo;d be a local celebrity. But except for books, I now actively avoid stuff. If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I&rsquo;ll take services over goods any day.I&rsquo;m not claiming this is because I&rsquo;ve achieved some kind of zenlike detachment from material things. I&rsquo;m talking about something more mundane. A historical change has taken place, and I&rsquo;ve now realized it. Stuff used to be valuable, and now it&rsquo;s not.In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in the middle of the twentieth century. As food got cheaper (or we got richer; they&rsquo;re indistinguishable), eating too much started to be a bigger danger than eating too little. We&rsquo;ve now reached that point with stuff. For most people, rich or poor, stuff has become a burden.The good news is, if you&rsquo;re carrying a burden without knowing it, your life could be better than you realize. Imagine walking around for years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having them removed.

<p>The Submarine April 2005&quot;Suits make a corporate comeback,&quot; says the New York Times. Why does this sound familiar? Maybe because the suit was also back in February, September 2004, June 2004, March 2004, September 2003, November 2002, April 2002, and February 2002. Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back? Because PR firms tell them to. One of the most surprising things I discovered during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry, lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the stories you read in traditional media that aren&rsquo;t about politics, crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.I know because I spent years hunting such &ldquo;press hits.&rdquo; Our startup spent its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000 a month. And they were worth it. PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories. [1]Our PR firm was one of the best in the business. In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications. And we weren&rsquo;t the only ones they did great things for. In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous fees. But I remember thinking his company&rsquo;s name was odd. Why call an auction site &ldquo;eBay&rdquo;? SymbiosisPR is not dishonest. Not quite. In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren&rsquo;t dishonest. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. A good PR firm won&rsquo;t bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they&rsquo;ve worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they don&rsquo;t want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.If anyone is dishonest, it&rsquo;s the reporters. The main reason PR firms exist is that reporters are lazy. Or, to put it more nicely, overworked. Really they ought to be out there digging up stories for themselves. But it&rsquo;s so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them. After all, they know good PR firms won&rsquo;t lie to them.A good flatterer doesn&rsquo;t lie, but tells his victim selective truths (what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the same strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth favors their clients.For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web let small merchants compete with big ones. This was perfectly true. But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants were our target market, and we were paying the piper.Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms. At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them. [2] The average trade publication is a bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. They&rsquo;re so desperate for &ldquo;content&rdquo; that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Their reporters do go out and find their own stories, at least some of the time. They&rsquo;ll listen to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. We managed to get press hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed to crack the print edition of the Times. [3]The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity. You don&rsquo;t pitch stories to them. You have to approach them as if you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves.Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one. We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the Web. We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral enough. But once this &ldquo;fact&rdquo; was out there in print, we could quote it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market.This was roughly true. We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size. But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements. For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes&rsquo;s conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers. This &ldquo;fact&rdquo; originated in Spamhaus&rsquo;s ROKSO list, which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top spammers. The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it&rsquo;s simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment. [4]All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly big spammer. But reporters don&rsquo;t want to print vague stuff like &ldquo;fairly big.&rdquo; They want statements with punch, like &ldquo;top ten.&rdquo; And PR firms give them what they want. Wearing suits, we&rsquo;re told, will make us 3.6 percent more productive.BuzzWhere the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of &ldquo;buzz.&rdquo; They usually feed the same story to several different publications at once. And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot. Which is exactly what they&rsquo;re supposed to think.When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first copies. None of them would have been there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain reaction.I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to track them at work. If you search for the obvious phrases, you turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the return of the suit. For example, the Reuters article that got picked up by USA Today in September 2004. &ldquo;The suit is back,&rdquo; it begins.Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms. Once you know how to read them, it&rsquo;s straightforward to figure out who the client is. With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more &ldquo;experts&rdquo; to talk about the industry generally. In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney. [5] When you get to the end of the experts, look for the client. And bingo, there it is: The Men&rsquo;s Wearhouse.Not surprising, considering The Men&rsquo;s Wearhouse was at that moment running ads saying &ldquo;The Suit is Back.&rdquo; Talk about a successful press hit&ndash; a wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy.The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm. Search for a few key phrases and the names of the clients and the experts, and you&rsquo;ll turn up other variants of this story.Casual fridays are out and dress codes are in writes Diane E. Lewis in The Boston Globe. In a remarkable coincidence, Ms. Lewis&rsquo;s industry contacts also include the creative director of GQ.Ripped jeans and T-shirts are out, writes Mary Kathleen Flynn in US News &amp; World Report. And she too knows the creative director of GQ.Men&rsquo;s suits are back writes Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz.Com (&ldquo;the ultimate men&rsquo;s entertainment magazine&rdquo;).Dressing down loses appeal as men suit up at the office writes Tenisha Mercer of The Detroit News. Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms. I propose we call this new sport &ldquo;PR diving,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m sure there are far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.OnlineAfter spending years chasing them, it&rsquo;s now second nature to me to recognize press hits for what they are. But before we hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media came from. I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn&rsquo;t realize why.Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether the author was telling the whole truth? If you really want to be a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth, but why he&rsquo;s writing about this subject at all.Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler. Most people who publish online write what they write for the simple reason that they want to. You can&rsquo;t see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as you can in so many print publications&ndash; which is one of the reasons, though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust bloggers more than Business Week.I was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper. He thought the print media were in serious trouble, and that they were still mostly in denial about it. &ldquo;They think the decline is cyclic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Actually it&rsquo;s structural.&ldquo;In other words, the readers are leaving, and they&rsquo;re not coming back. Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest. Imagine how incongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog: The urge to look corporate&ndash; sleek, commanding, prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve&ndash; is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace. The problem with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm. The whole tone is bogus. This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience.Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic. It&rsquo;s not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into molds of zippy journalese. It&rsquo;s people writing what they think.I didn&rsquo;t realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was. I&rsquo;m not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek. Since high school, at least, I&rsquo;ve thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as sources of information. But I didn&rsquo;t realize till the last few years that writing for publication didn&rsquo;t have to mean writing that way. I didn&rsquo;t realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.Readers aren&rsquo;t the only ones who&rsquo;ve noticed the change. The PR industry has too. A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the matter: Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they began blogging in the first place. PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them. And that means there may be a struggle ahead. As this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate. When I think how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional media, I can&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;ll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers, if they can figure out how. Notes[1] PR has at least one beneficial feature: it favors small companies. If PR didn&rsquo;t work, the only alternative would be to advertise, and only big companies can afford that.[2] Advertisers pay less for ads in free publications, because they assume readers ignore something they get for free. This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon.[3] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they&rsquo;re practically different papers. Whoever fed the style section reporter this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by the regular news reporters.[4] The most striking example I know of this type is the &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that the Internet worm of 1988 infected 6000 computers. I was there when it was cooked up, and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about 60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might have infected ten percent of them.Actually no one knows how many computers the worm infected, because the remedy was to reboot them, and this destroyed all traces. But people like numbers. And so this one is now replicated all over the Internet, like a little worm of its own.[5] Not all were necessarily supplied by the PR firm. Reporters sometimes call a few additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh vegetables to a can of soup.

<p>General and Surprising September 2017The most valuable insights are both general and surprising. F = ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g. gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g. platitudes).Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable insights. You get those from small additions of whichever quality was missing. The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that&rsquo;s more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them. Because these start out so general, you only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful insight.A small delta of novelty is all you&rsquo;ll be able to get most of the time. Which means if you take this route, your ideas will seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ve merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist. But don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Remember the huge multiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of something even a little new.Corollary: the more general the ideas you&rsquo;re talking about, the less you should worry about repeating yourself. If you write enough, it&rsquo;s inevitable you will. Your brain is much the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit it. I feel slightly bad when I find I&rsquo;ve said something close to what I&rsquo;ve said before, as if I were plagiarizing myself. But rationally one shouldn&rsquo;t. You won&rsquo;t say something exactly the same way the second time, and that variation increases the chance you&rsquo;ll get that tiny but critical delta of novelty.And of course, ideas beget ideas. (That sounds familiar.) An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one with more. But only if you keep going. So it&rsquo;s doubly important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who say there&rsquo;s not much new about something you&rsquo;ve discovered. &ldquo;Not much new&rdquo; is a real achievement when you&rsquo;re talking about the most general ideas. It&rsquo;s not true that there&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun. There are some domains where there&rsquo;s almost nothing new. But there&rsquo;s a big difference between nothing and almost nothing, when it&rsquo;s multiplied by the area under the sun. Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.Japanese Translation</p>

<p>The New Funding Landscape Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. October 2010After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called turmoil. At Y Combinator we&rsquo;ve seen dramatic changes in the funding environment for startups. Fortunately one of them is much higher valuations.The trends we&rsquo;ve been seeing are probably not YC-specific. I wish I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data points to see patterns clearly.What we&rsquo;re seeing now, everyone&rsquo;s probably going to be seeing in the next couple years. So I&rsquo;m going to explain what we&rsquo;re seeing, and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.Super-AngelsLet me start by describing what the world of startup funding used to look like. There used to be two sharply differentiated types of investors: angels and venture capitalists. Angels are individual rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people&rsquo;s.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called super-angels. [1] And VCs have been provoked by their arrival into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves. So the previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly blurred.There used to be a no man&rsquo;s land between angels and VCs. Angels would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more. So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.The no man&rsquo;s land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted to raise. Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise around $400k. But it was a pain to stitch together that much out of angel investments, and most VCs weren&rsquo;t interested in investments so small. That&rsquo;s the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. They&rsquo;re responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups, because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one another. Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs. That&rsquo;s going to change the rules about how to raise money. I don&rsquo;t know yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes will be for the better.A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of the qualities of a VC. They&rsquo;re usually individuals, like angels. In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of the classic type. But like VCs, they invest other people&rsquo;s money. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels: a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k. They make investment decisions quickly, like angels. And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people&rsquo;s money makes them doubly alarming to VCs. They don&rsquo;t just compete for startups; they also compete for investors. What super-angels really are is a new form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund. And those of us in the technology world know what usually happens when something comes along that can be described in terms like that. Usually it&rsquo;s the replacement.Will it be? As of now, few of the startups that take money from super-angels are ruling out taking VC money. They&rsquo;re just postponing it. But that&rsquo;s still a problem for VCs. Some of the startups that postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they raise that they never bother to raise more. And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do. If the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series A rounds, that would cut VCs&rsquo; returns from winners at least tenfold. [2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels. But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are concentrated in a few big successes. The expected value of a startup is the percentage chance it&rsquo;s Google. So to the extent that winning is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if they merely failed to get those few big winners. And there&rsquo;s a chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies. [3]Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have less partner per investment. They can&rsquo;t pay as much attention to you as a VC on your board could. How much is that extra attention worth? It will vary enormously from one partner to another. There&rsquo;s no consensus yet in the general case. So for now this is something startups are deciding individually.Till now, VCs&rsquo; claims about how much value they added were sort of like the government&rsquo;s. Maybe they made you feel better, but you had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only VCs could supply. Now that VCs have competitors, that&rsquo;s going to put a market price on the help they offer. The interesting thing is, no one knows yet what it will be.Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and connections only the top VCs can supply? Or would super-angel money do just as well? The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels will say you don&rsquo;t. But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even the VCs and super-angels themselves. All the super-angels know is that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying, and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry about.RoundsWhatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is good news for founders. And not just for the obvious reason that more competition for deals means better terms. The whole shape of deals is changing.One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount of your company they want. VCs want a lot. In a series A round they want a third of your company, if they can get it. They don&rsquo;t care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small. In a traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board. [4] Since board seats last about 5 years and each partner can&rsquo;t handle more than about 10 at once, that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner per year. And that means they need to get as much of the company as they can in each one. You&rsquo;d have to be a very promising startup indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a few percent of you.Since angels generally don&rsquo;t take board seats, they don&rsquo;t have this constraint. They&rsquo;re happy to buy only a few percent of you. And although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they&rsquo;ve retained this critical property of angels. They don&rsquo;t take board seats, so they don&rsquo;t need a big percentage of your company.Though that means you&rsquo;ll get correspondingly less attention from them, it&rsquo;s good news in other respects. Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted. It was a lot of the company to give up in one shot. Most founders doing series A deals would prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock after using the first half of the money to increase its value. But VCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative. Now it&rsquo;s easy to raise angel rounds about half the size of series A rounds. Many of the startups we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of startups in general.A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with a valuation cap of $4 million premoney. Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company. That&rsquo;s a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually give up in a series A round if you do it so early. [5]But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that they cause less dilution. You also lose less control. After an angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the company, whereas after a series A round they often don&rsquo;t. The traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders, two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person. Plus series A terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including selling the company. Founders usually have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things are going well. But that&rsquo;s not the same as just being able to do what you want, like you could before.A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that they&rsquo;re less stressful to raise. Raising a traditional series A round has in the past taken weeks, if not months. When a VC firm can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they&rsquo;re careful about which they do. To get a traditional series A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no. That&rsquo;s the really scary part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no. The chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages about 25%. At some firms it&rsquo;s over 50%.Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster. Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months. But they&rsquo;re still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback as it progresses. An angel round is not an all or nothing thing like a series A. It&rsquo;s composed of multiple investors with varying degrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit unequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like &ldquo;come back to me to fill out the round.&rdquo; You usually start collecting money from the most committed investors and work your way out toward the ambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.But at each point you know how you&rsquo;re doing. If investors turn cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting. Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm, actually raise the price to reflect demand.ValuationHowever, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels, and they have started to use it. VCs have started making angel-sized investments too. The term &ldquo;angel round&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round. Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments of a hundred thousand or two. And when VCs invest in angel rounds they can do things that super-angels don&rsquo;t like. VCs are quite valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are in general, and partly because they don&rsquo;t care that much about the returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to recruit startups for series A rounds later. So VCs who invest in angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels who invest in them. [6]Some super-angels seem to care about valuations. Several turned down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations were too high. This was not a problem for the startups; by definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it. But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations. Did they not understand that the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be smarter than they seem. It would make sense for super-angels to want low valuations if they&rsquo;re hoping to invest in startups that get bought early. If you&rsquo;re hoping to hit the next Google, you shouldn&rsquo;t care if the valuation is 20 million. But if you&rsquo;re looking for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care. If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only get 1.5x. You might as well buy Apple.So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could get acquired quickly, that would explain why they&rsquo;d care about valuations. But why would they be looking for those? Because depending on the meaning of &ldquo;quickly,&rdquo; it could actually be very profitable. A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover, a quick 10x return. Rate of return is what matters in investing—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year. If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that&rsquo;s a higher rate of return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public. To get the same rate of return, the VC would have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x. Even Google didn&rsquo;t come close to that.So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that will get bought. That&rsquo;s the only rational explanation for focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right companies. And if so they&rsquo;ll be different to deal with than VCs. They&rsquo;ll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want to sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs? I think the answer to that is, some of each. They&rsquo;ll each become more like one another. The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCs will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments faster. A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart, and there will probably be survivors from each group.What does that mean for founders? One thing it means is that the high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever. To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive VCs, they&rsquo;ll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and start to become more miserly about valuations. Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you. The super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the super-angels by driving up valuations. Which for founders will result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast, with high valuations.But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have to appeal to both super-angels and VCs. If you don&rsquo;t seem like you have the potential to go public, you won&rsquo;t be able to use VCs to drive up the valuation of an angel round.There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called signalling risk. If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing more later, what happens if they don&rsquo;t? That&rsquo;s a signal to everyone else that they think you&rsquo;re lame.How much should you worry about that? The seriousness of signalling risk depends on how far along you are. If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or traffic month after month, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about any signals your existing investors are sending. Your results will speak for themselves. [7]Whereas if the next time you need to raise money you won&rsquo;t yet have concrete results, you may need to think more about the message your investors might send if they don&rsquo;t invest more. I&rsquo;m not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new. But my instincts tell me you don&rsquo;t have to worry much. Signalling risk smells like one of those things founders worry about that&rsquo;s not a real problem. As a rule, the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself. Startups hurt themselves way more often than competitors hurt them, for example. I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.One thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the risk of taking money from VCs in angel rounds is not to take too much from any one VC. Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of turning down money.Fortunately, more and more startups will. After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition. That should last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. Unless there&rsquo;s some huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be a good time for startups to raise money. And that&rsquo;s exciting because it means lots more startups will happen. Notes[1] I&rsquo;ve also heard them called &ldquo;Mini-VCs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Micro-VCs.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know which name will stick.There were a couple predecessors. Ron Conway had angel funds starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a super-angel than a VC fund.[2] It wouldn&rsquo;t cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage of startups as they do now. So it&rsquo;s hard to predict precisely what would happen to their returns.[3] The brand of an investor derives mostly from the success of their portfolio companies. The top VCs thus have a big brand advantage over the super-angels. They could make it self-perpetuating if they used it to get all the best new startups. But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be able to. To get all the best startups, you have to do more than make them want you. You also have to want them; you have to recognize them when you see them, and that&rsquo;s much harder. Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss. And that will cause the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually to erode.[4] Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round board, consisting of two founders and one VC. Which is also to the founders&rsquo; advantage if it means they still control the company.[5] In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you dilute yourselves to set aside an &ldquo;option pool&rdquo; as well. I predict this practice will gradually disappear though.[6] The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible note with no valuation cap at all. In that case the money invested in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the next round, no matter how large. Angels and super-angels tend not to like uncapped notes. They have no idea how much of the company they&rsquo;re buying. If the company does well and the valuation of the next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it. So by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don&rsquo;t care about valuations in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.[7] Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you&rsquo;ll never need to raise more money. But startups are often mistaken about that.Thanks to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Patrick Collison, James Lindenbaum, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Superlinear Returns October 2023One of the most important things I didn&rsquo;t understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. &ldquo;You get out,&rdquo; I heard a thousand times, &ldquo;what you put in.&rdquo; They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.It&rsquo;s obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we&rsquo;ve invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [1]You can&rsquo;t understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you&rsquo;re ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you&rsquo;re working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they&rsquo;re tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who&rsquo;s adept at it and someone who&rsquo;s not is very great.Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don&rsquo;t. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.YC doesn&rsquo;t explicitly tell founders that with growth rate &ldquo;you get out what you put in,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt.Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling.Whenever how well you do depends on how well you&rsquo;ve done, you&rsquo;ll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.What we don&rsquo;t understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don&rsquo;t have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they&rsquo;d have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one&rsquo;s territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn&rsquo;t affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one&rsquo;s own life.The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn&rsquo;t affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect. [2]That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven&rsquo;t fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they&rsquo;re benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it.The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression &ldquo;winner take all.&rdquo; In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better. [3]The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It&rsquo;s that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don&rsquo;t need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you&rsquo;re the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target.It&rsquo;s remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it&rsquo;s so concentrated is thresholds: there&rsquo;s only so much room on the A-list in the average person&rsquo;s head.The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you&rsquo;re able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin. Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you&rsquo;re building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you&rsquo;re doing badly as it&rsquo;s happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you&rsquo;re learning a lot, then you&rsquo;re getting exponential growth nonetheless.This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren&rsquo;t blindly tolerant of failure. They&rsquo;ll only continue to bet on you if you&rsquo;re learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn&rsquo;t grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don&rsquo;t consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you&rsquo;re not learning, you&rsquo;re probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.But don&rsquo;t overoptimize what you&rsquo;re learning. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You&rsquo;re learning; you don&rsquo;t know for sure yet what&rsquo;s going to be valuable, and if you&rsquo;re too strict you&rsquo;ll lop off the outliers.What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form &ldquo;seek thresholds&rdquo; or &ldquo;seek competition?&rdquo; Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you&rsquo;ll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you&rsquo;re no better off. &ldquo;Seek competition&rdquo; is similarly useless; what if the prize isn&rsquo;t worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it&rsquo;s trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape. [4]A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here&rsquo;s one that does: if you come across something that&rsquo;s mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they&rsquo;d buy a better alternative if you made one. [5]It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there&rsquo;s hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn&rsquo;t likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they&rsquo;d be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you&rsquo;re supposed to. The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there&rsquo;s good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing.There are two reasons for this, though they&rsquo;re so closely intertwined that they&rsquo;re more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations.Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren&rsquo;t part of an organization, you weren&rsquo;t likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences. [6]A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don&rsquo;t require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.There&rsquo;s still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what&rsquo;s at stake. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance.Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn&rsquo;t imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That&rsquo;s an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they&rsquo;re so good that they&rsquo;ll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out. [7]The switch away from institutions won&rsquo;t simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they&rsquo;d never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up. Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. [8] But if you&rsquo;re an ambitious individual it&rsquo;s good news for you. How should you take advantage of it?The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there&rsquo;s less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it&rsquo;s hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it&rsquo;s not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to.There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it&rsquo;s even more valuable to know what you&rsquo;re interested in, and to find ways to work on it. [9] It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there&rsquo;s a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you&rsquo;re young and don&rsquo;t yet have children.There&rsquo;s a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of trying hard. I&rsquo;m going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph.Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they&rsquo;re full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you&rsquo;re lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you&rsquo;re not failing occasionally you&rsquo;re probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what&rsquo;s worth paying attention to. [10]And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it&rsquo;s even more of a factor when you&rsquo;re working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there&rsquo;s also a component of true chance that you can&rsquo;t do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early. The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at the limits of knowledge.The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton&rsquo;s discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries&rsquo; combined. [11]This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well. [12]This is obviously the case in science. You can&rsquo;t publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it&rsquo;s just as true in investing, for example. It&rsquo;s only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don&rsquo;t; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there&rsquo;s no room to make money.What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I&rsquo;ll never get anywhere. But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it&rsquo;s worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.In the startup world, the name for this principle is &ldquo;do things that don&rsquo;t scale.&rdquo; If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you&rsquo;ll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it&rsquo;s worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.There&rsquo;s another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we&rsquo;ve inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase &ldquo;your work&rdquo; means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they&rsquo;re currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it&rsquo;s part of their portfolio. It&rsquo;s an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don&rsquo;t need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you&rsquo;ll end up in one. Your curiosity won&rsquo;t let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they&rsquo;re not already part of one.The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.NotesThere&rsquo;s a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because they&rsquo;re not sharply distinguished in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they&rsquo;re not meaningless. I&rsquo;ve tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error.[1] Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to empathize with because we&rsquo;re not the recipients; we&rsquo;re the returns.[2] Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people.[3] It&rsquo;s not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother.[4] Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It&rsquo;s also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it&rsquo;s a sign that other people find them promising. But it&rsquo;s a very imperfect sign: often there&rsquo;s a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one.[5] Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there&rsquo;s often a hidden reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons.[6] In my twenties I wanted to be an artist and even went to art school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations.[7] In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where the return curve gets really steep.[8] It&rsquo;s unclear exactly what advocates of &ldquo;equity&rdquo; mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else.It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don&rsquo;t think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance.[9] Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.[10] The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of &ldquo;How to Do Great Work.&rdquo; As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because after I finished &ldquo;How to Do Great Work&rdquo; I rewrote it based on that.[11] Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies the ratio has shifted dramatically toward discovery just in the last half century.[12] It&rsquo;s not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it. But it&rsquo;s not simply that they don&rsquo;t want anyone to have what they can&rsquo;t. The conventional-minded literally can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Black Swan Farming Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. September 2012I&rsquo;ve done several types of work over the years but I don&rsquo;t know another as counterintuitive as startup investing.The two most important things to understand about startup investing, as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look initially like bad ideas.The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn&rsquo;t really grasp till it happened to us. The total value of the companies we&rsquo;ve funded is around 10 billion, give or take a few. But just two companies, Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our expectations about variation. I don&rsquo;t know whether these expectations are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in startup investing.That yields all sorts of strange consequences. For example, in purely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns, and the rest are just a cost of doing business. [1] I haven&rsquo;t really assimilated that fact, partly because it&rsquo;s so counterintuitive, and partly because we&rsquo;re not doing this just for financial reasons; YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per batch. And yet it&rsquo;s true.To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through clouds. [2] You need to do what you know intellectually to be right, even though it feels wrong.It&rsquo;s a constant battle for us. It&rsquo;s hard to make ourselves take enough risks. When you interview a startup and think &ldquo;they seem likely to succeed,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s hard not to fund them. And yet, financially at least, there is only one kind of success: they&rsquo;re either going to be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the effect on your returns will be insignificant. In the same day of interviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren&rsquo;t even sure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seem small. But again, it&rsquo;s not their chances of succeeding that matter but their chances of succeeding really big. The probability that any group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that of the other, safer group.The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all. If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed at all, and you&rsquo;d get that fraction of big hits. Unfortunately picking winners is harder than that. You have to ignore the elephant in front of you, the likelihood they&rsquo;ll succeed, and focus instead on the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether they&rsquo;ll succeed really big.HarderThat&rsquo;s made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at first like bad ideas. I&rsquo;ve written about this before: if a good idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it. So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few beside them realize are good. Which is not that far from a description of insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that illustrates the situation perfectly. He drew two intersecting circles, one labelled &ldquo;seems like a bad idea&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;is a good idea.&rdquo; The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram is illuminating. It reminds you that there is an intersection—that there are good ideas that seem bad. It also reminds you that the vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even harder to recognize the big winners. It means the probability of a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with a high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately low probability of the latter.History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect it seems obvious they were going to make it big. For that reason one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to me when I first heard about it. A site for college students to waste time? It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn&rsquo;t matter.One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same terms. [3]Harder StillWait, it gets worse. You not only have to solve this hard problem, but you have to do it with no indication of whether you&rsquo;re succeeding. When you pick a big winner, you won&rsquo;t know it for two years.Meanwhile, the one thing you can measure is dangerously misleading. The one thing we can track precisely is how well the startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day. But we know that&rsquo;s the wrong metric. There&rsquo;s no correlation between the percentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does matter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big winner or not.Except an inverse one. That&rsquo;s the scary thing: fundraising is not merely a useless metric, but positively misleading. We&rsquo;re in a business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and the huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our net very widely. The big winners could generate 10,000x returns. That means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companies that returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded were able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainly mean we were being too conservative. [4]It takes a conscious effort not to do that too. After 15 cycles of preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do, I can now look at a group we&rsquo;re interviewing through Demo Day investors&rsquo; eyes. But those are the wrong eyes to look through!We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors. And since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford to take more risk you should. What would it mean to take 10x more risk than Demo Day investors? We&rsquo;d have to be willing to fund 10x more startups than they would. Which means that even if we&rsquo;re generous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a startup&rsquo;s expected value, we&rsquo;d be taking the right amount of risk if only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding after Demo Day.I don&rsquo;t know what fraction of them currently raise more after Demo Day. I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if you start measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it&rsquo;s the wrong thing to optimize. [5] But the percentage is certainly way over 30%. And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate at fundraising makes my stomach clench. A Demo Day where only 30% of the startups were fundable would be a shambles. Everyone would agree that YC had jumped the shark. We ourselves would feel that YC had jumped the shark. And yet we&rsquo;d all be wrong.For better or worse that&rsquo;s never going to be more than a thought experiment. We could never stand it. How about that for counterintuitive? I can lay out what I know to be the right thing to do, and still not do it. I can make up all sorts of plausible justifications. It would hurt YC&rsquo;s brand (at least among the innumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups that flamed out. It might dilute the value of the alumni network. Perhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to be up to our chins in failure all the time. But I know the real reason we&rsquo;re so conservative is that we just haven&rsquo;t assimilated the fact of 1000x variation in returns.We&rsquo;ll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risks proportionate to the returns in this business. The best we can hope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselves thinking &ldquo;they seem like good founders, but what are investors going to think of this crazy idea?&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll continue to be able to say &ldquo;who cares what investors think?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we thought about Airbnb, and if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinking it.Notes[1] I&rsquo;m not saying that the big winners are all that matters, just that they&rsquo;re all that matters financially for investors. Since we&rsquo;re not doing YC mainly for financial reasons, the big winners aren&rsquo;t all that matters to us. We&rsquo;re delighted to have funded Reddit, for example. Even though we made comparatively little from it, Reddit has had a big effect on the world, and it introduced us to Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both of whom have become good friends.Nor do we push founders to try to become one of the big winners if they don&rsquo;t want to. We didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;swing for the fences&rdquo; in our own startup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would feel pretty bogus to press founders to do something we didn&rsquo;t do. Our rule is that it&rsquo;s up to the founders. Some want to take over the world, and some just want that first few million. But we invest in so many companies that we don&rsquo;t have to sweat any one outcome. In fact, we don&rsquo;t have to sweat whether startups have exits at all. The biggest exits are the only ones that matter financially, and those are guaranteed in the sense that if a company becomes big enough, a market for its shares will inevitably arise. Since the remaining outcomes don&rsquo;t have a significant effect on returns, it&rsquo;s cool with us if the founders want to sell early for a small amount, or grow slowly and never sell (i.e. become a so-called lifestyle business), or even shut the company down. We&rsquo;re sometimes disappointed when a startup we had high hopes for doesn&rsquo;t do well, but this disappointment is mostly the ordinary variety that anyone feels when that happens.[2] Without visual cues (e.g. the horizon) you can&rsquo;t distinguish between gravity and acceleration. Which means if you&rsquo;re flying through clouds you can&rsquo;t tell what the attitude of the aircraft is. You could feel like you&rsquo;re flying straight and level while in fact you&rsquo;re descending in a spiral. The solution is to ignore what your body is telling you and listen only to your instruments. But it turns out to be very hard to ignore what your body is telling you. Every pilot knows about this problem and yet it is still a leading cause of accidents.[3] Not all big hits follow this pattern though. The reason Google seemed a bad idea was that there were already lots of search engines and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be room for another.[4] A startup&rsquo;s success at fundraising is a function of two things: what they&rsquo;re selling and how good they are at selling it. And while we can teach startups a lot about how to appeal to investors, even the most convincing pitch can&rsquo;t sell an idea that investors don&rsquo;t like. I was genuinely worried that Airbnb, for example, would not be able to raise money after Demo Day. I couldn&rsquo;t convince Fred Wilson to fund them. They might not have raised money at all but for the coincidence that Greg McAdoo, our contact at Sequoia, was one of a handful of VCs who understood the vacation rental business, having spent much of the previous two years investigating it.[5] I calculated it once for the last batch before a consortium of investors started offering investment automatically to every startup we funded, summer 2010. At the time it was 94% (33 of 35 companies that tried to raise money succeeded, and one didn&rsquo;t try because they were already profitable). Presumably it&rsquo;s lower now because of that investment; in the old days it was raise after Demo Day or die.Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>Tablets December 2010I was thinking recently how inconvenient it was not to have a general term for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things running Android. The closest to a general term seems to be &ldquo;mobile devices,&rdquo; but that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn&rsquo;t really capture what&rsquo;s distinctive about the iPad.After a few seconds it struck me that what we&rsquo;ll end up calling these things is tablets. The only reason we even consider calling them &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; is that the iPhone preceded the iPad. If the iPad had come first, we wouldn&rsquo;t think of the iPhone as a phone; we&rsquo;d think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.The iPhone isn&rsquo;t so much a phone as a replacement for a phone. That&rsquo;s an important distinction, because it&rsquo;s an early instance of what will become a common pattern. Many if not most of the special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps running on tablets.This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, and cameras. But I think it will surprise people how many things are going to get replaced. We funded one startup that&rsquo;s replacing keys. The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad effectively replaces reading glasses. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if by playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could even replace the bathroom scale.The advantages of doing things in software on a single device are so great that everything that can get turned into software will. So for the next couple years, a good recipe for startups will be to look around you for things that people haven&rsquo;t realized yet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the term ephemeralization to describe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced by what we would now call software. The reason tablets are going to take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co are industrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind them. The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas. No one who has studied the history of technology would want to underestimate the power of that force.I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behind them. I don&rsquo;t want to see another era of client monoculture like the Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s. But if ephemeralization is one of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggests a way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets have accelerometers in them. Developers have used the accelerometer in ways Apple could never have imagined. That&rsquo;s the nature of platforms. The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people will use it. So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can we put in there? Not merely hardware, but software too. What else can we give developers access to? Give hackers an inch and they&rsquo;ll take you a mile. Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>

		<h1 id="talk">Talk</h1>
<p>Write Like You Talk October 2015Here&rsquo;s a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language.Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write in a different language than they&rsquo;d use if they were talking to a friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different. No one uses &ldquo;pen&rdquo; as a verb in spoken English. You&rsquo;d feel like an idiot using &ldquo;pen&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;write&rdquo; in a conversation with a friend.The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago: The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: &ldquo;After Altamira, all is decadence.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s from Neil Oliver&rsquo;s A History of Ancient Britain. I feel bad making an example of this book, because it&rsquo;s no worse than lots of others. But just imagine calling Picasso &ldquo;the mercurial Spaniard&rdquo; when talking to a friend. Even one sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation. And yet people write whole books of it.Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make written language worse?If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes. Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read. It&rsquo;s also more formal and distant, which gives the reader&rsquo;s attention permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that you&rsquo;re saying more than you actually are.You don&rsquo;t need complex sentences to express complex ideas. When specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas in their field, they don&rsquo;t use sentences any more complex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch. They use different words, certainly. But even those they use no more than necessary. And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove, and partly because the harder the ideas you&rsquo;re talking about, the less you can afford to let language get in the way.Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.I&rsquo;m not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much music as text, so you can say things you wouldn&rsquo;t say in conversation. And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers don&rsquo;t want to make it easy to understand what they&rsquo;re saying—in corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more bogus end of the humanities. But for nearly everyone else, spoken language is better.It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language. So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask &ldquo;Is this the way I&rsquo;d say this if I were talking to a friend?&rdquo; If it isn&rsquo;t, imagine what you would say, and use that instead. After a while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write something you wouldn&rsquo;t say, you&rsquo;ll hear the clank as it hits the page.Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything that doesn&rsquo;t sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are phonetically awkward; I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s necessary, but it doesn&rsquo;t cost much.This trick may not always be enough. I&rsquo;ve seen writing so far removed from spoken language that it couldn&rsquo;t be fixed sentence by sentence. For cases like that there&rsquo;s a more drastic solution. After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking. The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people manage to write in spoken language. Otherwise everyone&rsquo;s writing would sound like them talking.If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you&rsquo;ll be ahead of 95% of writers. And it&rsquo;s so easy to do: just don&rsquo;t let a sentence through unless it&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;d say it to a friend.Thanks to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.Japanese TranslationArabic Translation</p>

<p>Taste for Makers February 2002 &ldquo;&hellip;Copernicus&rsquo; aesthetic objections to [equants] provided one essential motive for his rejection of the Ptolemaic system&hellip;.&rdquo;- Thomas Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution&quot;All of us had been trained by Kelly Johnson and believed fanatically in his insistence that an airplane that looked beautiful would fly the same way.&quot;- Ben Rich, Skunk Works&quot;Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.&quot;- G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician&rsquo;s Apology I was talking recently to a friend who teaches at MIT. His field is hot now and every year he is inundated by applications from would-be graduate students. &ldquo;A lot of them seem smart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t tell is whether they have any kind of taste.&ldquo;Taste. You don&rsquo;t hear that word much now. And yet we still need the underlying concept, whatever we call it. What my friend meant was that he wanted students who were not just good technicians, but who could use their technical knowledge to design beautiful things.Mathematicians call good work &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; and so, either now or in the past, have scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers, writers, and painters. Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is there some overlap in what they meant? If there is an overlap, can we use one field&rsquo;s discoveries about beauty to help us in another?For those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical questions. If there is such a thing as beauty, we need to be able to recognize it. We need good taste to make good things. Instead of treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy abstractions, let&rsquo;s try considering it as a practical question: how do you make good stuff?If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that &ldquo;taste is subjective.&rdquo; They believe this because it really feels that way to them. When they like something, they have no idea why. It could be because it&rsquo;s beautiful, or because their mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one in a magazine, or because they know it&rsquo;s expensive. Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle unexamined. If you make fun of your little brother for coloring people green in his coloring book, your mother is likely to tell you something like &ldquo;you like to do it your way and he likes to do it his way.&ldquo;Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you important truths about aesthetics. She&rsquo;s trying to get the two of you to stop bickering.Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one contradicts other things they tell us. After dinning into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference, they take you to the museum and tell you that you should pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.What goes through the kid&rsquo;s head at this point? What does he think &ldquo;great artist&rdquo; means? After having been told for years that everyone just likes to do things their own way, he is unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great artist is someone whose work is better than the others&rsquo;. A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of the universe, is that a great artist is something that&rsquo;s good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it&rsquo;s not true. You feel this when you start to design things.Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better. Football players like to win games. CEOs like to increase earnings. It&rsquo;s a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at your job. But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job. If taste is just personal preference, then everyone&rsquo;s is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that&rsquo;s it.As in any job, as you continue to design things, you&rsquo;ll get better at it. Your tastes will change. And, like anyone who gets better at their job, you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re getting better. If so, your old tastes were not merely different, but worse. Poof goes the axiom that taste can&rsquo;t be wrong.Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows. But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself, that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you can start to study good design in detail. How has your taste changed? When you made mistakes, what caused you to make them? What have other people learned about design?Once you start to examine the question, it&rsquo;s surprising how much different fields&rsquo; ideas of beauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again.Good design is simple. You hear this from math to painting. In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be a better one. Where axioms are concerned, especially, less is more. It means much the same thing in programming. For architects and designers it means that beauty should depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial ornament. (Ornament is not in itself bad, only when it&rsquo;s camouflage on insipid form.) Similarly, in painting, a still life of a few carefully observed and solidly modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a stretch of flashy but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar. In writing it means: say what you mean and say it briefly.It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. You&rsquo;d think simple would be the default. Ornate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. Beginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn&rsquo;t sound anything like the way they speak. Designers trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they&rsquo;re expressionists. It&rsquo;s all evasion. Underneath the long words or the &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; brush strokes, there is not much going on, and that&rsquo;s frightening.When you&rsquo;re forced to be simple, you&rsquo;re forced to face the real problem. When you can&rsquo;t deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.Good design is timeless. In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake. So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics? He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did: if something is ugly, it can&rsquo;t be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it.Aiming at timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer: if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself. Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they left little room for those who came after. Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade the grip of fashion. Fashions almost by definition change with time, so if you can make something that will still look good far into the future, then its appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations. It&rsquo;s hard to guess what the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions. So if you can make something that appeals to people today and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good chance it will appeal to people in 2500.Good design solves the right problem. The typical stove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial to control each. How do you arrange the dials? The simplest answer is to put them in a row. But this is a simple answer to the wrong question. The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row, the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time about which dial matches which burner. Better to arrange the dials in a square like the burners.A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided. In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for setting text in sans-serif fonts. These fonts are closer to the pure, underlying letterforms. But in text that&rsquo;s not the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve. For legibility it&rsquo;s more important that letters be easy to tell apart. It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is easy to tell from a lowercase y.Problems can be improved as well as solutions. In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced by an equivalent one that&rsquo;s easy to solve. Physics progressed faster as the problem became predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it with scripture.Good design is suggestive. Jane Austen&rsquo;s novels contain almost no description; instead of telling you how everything looks, she tells her story so well that you envision the scene for yourself. Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging than one that tells. Everyone makes up their own story about the Mona Lisa.In architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it how you want: a good building, for example, will serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead of making them live as if they were executing a program written by the architect.In software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. In math it means a proof that becomes the basis for a lot of new work is preferable to a proof that was difficult, but doesn&rsquo;t lead to future discoveries; in the sciences generally, citation is considered a rough indicator of merit.Good design is often slightly funny. This one may not always be true. But Durer&rsquo;s engravings and Saarinen&rsquo;s womb chair and the Pantheon and the original Porsche 911 all seem to me slightly funny. Godel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem seems like a practical joke.I think it&rsquo;s because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one&rsquo;s sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one&rsquo;s sense of humor is to be wounded by them. And so the mark&ndash; or at least the prerogative&ndash; of strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings&ndash; or Shakespeare, for that matter.Good design may not have to be funny, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine something that could be called humorless also being good design.Good design is hard. If you look at the people who&rsquo;ve done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they worked very hard. If you&rsquo;re not working hard, you&rsquo;re probably wasting your time.Hard problems call for great efforts. In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions, and those tend to be interesting. Ditto in engineering.When you have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary out of your pack. And so an architect who has to build on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he is forced to produce an elegant design. Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business of solving the problem at all.Not every kind of hard is good. There is good pain and bad pain. You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the kind you get from stepping on a nail. A difficult problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable materials would not be.In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to paintings of people. There is something to this tradition, and not just because pictures of faces get to press buttons in our brains that other pictures don&rsquo;t. We are so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who draws them to work hard to satisfy us. If you draw a tree and you change the angle of a branch five degrees, no one will know. When you change the angle of someone&rsquo;s eye five degrees, people notice.When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan&rsquo;s &ldquo;form follows function,&rdquo; what they meant was, form should follow function. And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error. Wild animals are beautiful because they have hard lives.Good design looks easy. Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.In science and engineering, some of the greatest discoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself, I could have thought of that. The discoverer is entitled to reply, why didn&rsquo;t you?Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines. You look at them and you think, all you have to do is get eight or ten lines in the right place and you&rsquo;ve made this beautiful portrait. Well, yes, but you have to get them in exactly the right place. The slightest error will make the whole thing collapse.Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual medium, because they demand near perfection. In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser artists literally solve the same problems by successive approximation. One of the reasons kids give up drawing at ten or so is that they decide to start drawing like grownups, and one of the first things they try is a line drawing of a face. Smack!In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with practice. Perhaps what practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought. In some cases you literally train your body. An expert pianist can play notes faster than the brain can send signals to his hand. Likewise an artist, after a while, can make visual perception flow in through his eye and out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to a beat.When people talk about being in &ldquo;the zone,&rdquo; I think what they mean is that the spinal cord has the situation under control. Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and it frees conscious thought for the hard problems. Good design uses symmetry. I think symmetry may just be one way to achieve simplicity, but it&rsquo;s important enough to be mentioned on its own. Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion. Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the pattern of veins in a leaf.Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to excesses in the past. Architects started consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the 1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plot of a novel. You find the same in music and art. Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making the whole picture out of the same atoms. Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings, especially when two halves react to one another, as in the Creation of Adam or American Gothic.In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win. Inductive proofs are wonderfully short. In software, a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for thought.Good design resembles nature. It&rsquo;s not so much that resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature has had a long time to work on the problem. It&rsquo;s a good sign when your answer resembles nature&rsquo;s.It&rsquo;s not cheating to copy. Few would deny that a story should be like life. Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its role has often been misunderstood. The aim is not simply to make a record. The point of painting from life is that it gives your mind something to chew on: when your eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more interesting work.Imitating nature also works in engineering. Boats have long had spines and ribs like an animal&rsquo;s ribcage. In some cases we may have to wait for better technology: early aircraft designers were mistaken to design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn&rsquo;t have materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights&rsquo; engine weighed 152 lbs. and generated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated enough for machines that flew like birds, but I could imagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying like birds in fifty years.Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature&rsquo;s method as well as its results. Genetic algorithms may let us create things too complex to design in the ordinary sense.Good design is redesign. It&rsquo;s rare to get things right the first time. Experts expect to throw away some early work. They plan for plans to change.It takes confidence to throw work away. You have to be able to think, there&rsquo;s more where that came from. When people first start drawing, for example, they&rsquo;re often reluctant to redo parts that aren&rsquo;t right; they feel they&rsquo;ve been lucky to get that far, and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse. Instead they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad, really&ndash; in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.Dangerous territory, that; if anything you should cultivate dissatisfaction. In Leonardo&rsquo;s drawings there are often five or six attempts to get a line right. The distinctive back of the Porsche 911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkward prototype. In Wright&rsquo;s early plans for the Guggenheim, the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the present shape.Mistakes are natural. Instead of treating them as disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix. Leonardo more or less invented the sketch, as a way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration. Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the possibility of bugs.It helps to have a medium that makes change easy. When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century, it helped painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted. Good design can copy. Attitudes to copying often make a round trip. A novice imitates without knowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it&rsquo;s more important to be right than original.Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design. If you don&rsquo;t know where your ideas are coming from, you&rsquo;re probably imitating an imitator. Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several removes. It was this, more than Raphael&rsquo;s own work, that bothered the Pre-Raphaelites.The ambitious are not content to imitate. The second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality.I think the greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness. They just want to get the right answer, and if part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, that&rsquo;s no reason not to use it. They&rsquo;re confident enough to take from anyone without feeling that their own vision will be lost in the process. Good design is often strange. Some of the very best work has an uncanny quality: Euler&rsquo;s Formula, Bruegel&rsquo;s Hunters in the Snow, the SR-71, Lisp. They&rsquo;re not just beautiful, but strangely beautiful.I&rsquo;m not sure why. It may just be my own stupidity. A can-opener must seem miraculous to a dog. Maybe if I were smart enough it would seem the most natural thing in the world that ei*pi = -1. It is after all necessarily true.Most of the qualities I&rsquo;ve mentioned are things that can be cultivated, but I don&rsquo;t think it works to cultivate strangeness. The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear. Einstein didn&rsquo;t try to make relativity strange. He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted most of all to develop a personal style. But if you just try to make good things, you&rsquo;ll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person walks in a distinctive way. Michelangelo was not trying to paint like Michelangelo. He was just trying to paint well; he couldn&rsquo;t help painting like Michelangelo.The only style worth having is the one you can&rsquo;t help. And this is especially true for strangeness. There is no shortcut to it. The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists, the Romantics, and two generations of American high school students have searched for does not seem to exist. The only way to get there is to go through good and come out the other side. Good design happens in chunks. The inhabitants of fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo. Milan at the time was as big as Florence. How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century. And it can&rsquo;t have been heredity, because it isn&rsquo;t happening now. You have to assume that whatever inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were people born in Milan with just as much. What happened to the Milanese Leonardo?There are roughly a thousand times as many people alive in the US right now as lived in Florence during the fifteenth century. A thousand Leonardos and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us. If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic marvels. We aren&rsquo;t, and the reason is that to make Leonardo you need more than his innate ability. You also need Florence in 1450.Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems. Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born near Milan instead of Florence. Today we move around more, but great work still comes disproportionately from a few hotspots: the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the New Yorker, Lockheed&rsquo;s Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you&rsquo;re too far removed from one of these centers. You can push or pull these trends to some extent, but you can&rsquo;t break away from them. (Maybe you can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn&rsquo;t.) Good design is often daring. At every period of history, people have believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable. As far as I can tell it isn&rsquo;t.This problem afflicts not just every era, but in some degree every field. Much Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular: according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and Fra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their work. Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists, and was not fully accepted for decades&ndash; in France, not until the 1950s.Today&rsquo;s experimental error is tomorrow&rsquo;s new theory. If you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and truth don&rsquo;t quite meet, you should pay particular attention to them.As a practical matter, I think it&rsquo;s easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty. Most of the people who&rsquo;ve made beautiful things seem to have done it by fixing something that they thought ugly. Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees something and thinks, I could do better than that. Giotto saw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to a formula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to him they looked wooden and unnatural. Copernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporaries could tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough. You have to understand a field well before you develop a good nose for what needs fixing. You have to do your homework. But as you become expert in a field, you&rsquo;ll start to hear little voices saying, What a hack! There must be a better way. Don&rsquo;t ignore those voices. Cultivate them. The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.NotesSullivan actually said &ldquo;form ever follows function,&rdquo; but I think the usual misquotation is closer to what modernist architects meant.

<p>How to Think for Yourself November 2020There are some kinds of work that you can&rsquo;t do well without thinking differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for example, it&rsquo;s not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can&rsquo;t publish papers saying things other people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized yet.The same is true for investors. It&rsquo;s not enough for a public market investor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of other people make the same prediction, the stock price will already reflect it, and there&rsquo;s no room to make money. The only valuable insights are the ones most other investors don&rsquo;t share.You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don&rsquo;t want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn&rsquo;t  like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers&rsquo; floors.Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.But this pattern isn&rsquo;t universal. In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t hold for most kinds of work. In most kinds of work  to be an administrator, for example  all you need is the first half. All you need is to be right. It&rsquo;s not essential that everyone else be wrong.There&rsquo;s room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in practice there&rsquo;s a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of work where it&rsquo;s essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds where it&rsquo;s not.I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid, because it&rsquo;s one of the most important things to think about when you&rsquo;re deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently from everyone else? I suspect most people&rsquo;s unconscious mind will answer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to. I know mine does.Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than nurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you&rsquo;re going to be unhappy. If you&rsquo;re naturally independent-minded, you&rsquo;re going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you&rsquo;re naturally conventional-minded, you&rsquo;re going to be sailing into a headwind if you try to do original research.One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about where they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded. Conventional-minded people don&rsquo;t like to think of themselves as conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them as if they make up their own minds about everything. It&rsquo;s just a coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers&rsquo;. And the independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different their ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state them publicly. [1]By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart they are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems), because they&rsquo;re constantly being tested and ranked according to it. But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the extent they try to suppress it. So we don&rsquo;t get anything like the same kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where the most conventional-minded people are confident that they&rsquo;re independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry they might not be independent-minded enough. ___________ Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This quality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify it, or at least not to suppress it.One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It&rsquo;s hard to be a conformist if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out.It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you&rsquo;re surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you&rsquo;ll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of more.Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once they have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they haven&rsquo;t yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an inward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both of which magnify the forces of conformism. So high school is often a bad time for the independent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation that makes you think &ldquo;this is like high school,&rdquo; you know you should get out. [2]Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup wouldn&rsquo;t be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted. This causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the company starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders find themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other companies than with their own employees. [3]Fortunately you don&rsquo;t have to spend all your time with independent-minded people. It&rsquo;s enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly. And once you find them, they&rsquo;re usually as eager to talk as you are; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the kind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities are still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most students will still be conventional-minded, but you&rsquo;ll at least find clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero you may have found in high school.It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating a small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meet as many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the influence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups of peers. Plus if you&rsquo;re part of several different worlds, you can often import ideas from one to another.But by different types of people, I don&rsquo;t mean demographically different. For this technique to work, they have to think differently. So while it&rsquo;s an excellent idea to go and visit other countries, you can probably find people who think differently right around the corner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual (which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I try to learn what they know that other people don&rsquo;t. There are almost always surprises here. It&rsquo;s a good way to make conversation when you meet strangers, but I don&rsquo;t do it to make conversation. I really want to know.You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space, by reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn what happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who lived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do, but worth the effort for the same reason it&rsquo;s worth travelling far to triangulate a point.You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t say it out loud. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you&rsquo;re told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene. And you&rsquo;ll be surprised, when you start asking &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo;, how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If you have any imagination, you&rsquo;re more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few.More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your head unexamined, and things don&rsquo;t always enter your head in the form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit. How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how other people get their ideas.When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas spreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are in fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt, and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing the same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are intellectual fashions too, and you definitely don&rsquo;t want to participate in those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own thoughts, but because unfashionable ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting. The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is looking. [4] ___________ To go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal structure of independent-mindedness  at the individual muscles we need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and curiosity.Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things that are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. For most people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes: the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain. [5] To the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy. They&rsquo;re willing to have anything in their heads, from highly speculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects they care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully considered degree of belief. [6]The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can&rsquo;t be truly independent-minded. It&rsquo;s not enough just to have resistance to being told what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And since these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured to capture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinary people, because they&rsquo;re subject to a much more exacting master than mere convention. [7]Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so. In my experience, merely thinking about something you&rsquo;re fastidious about causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one of those rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And if it&rsquo;s like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also be possible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose of it from my father. [8]The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being told what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to think of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use reinforces that idea. You&rsquo;re unconventional. You don&rsquo;t care what other people think. But it&rsquo;s not just a kind of immunity. In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force. It&rsquo;s not mere skepticism, but an active delight in ideas that subvert the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical jokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because novel ideas are funny per se, but because novelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But while not identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite correlation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded  just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded. [9]I don&rsquo;t think we can significantly increase our resistance to being told what to think. It seems the most innate of the three components of independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adults usually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we can&rsquo;t increase our resistance to being told what to think, we can at least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with other independent-minded people.The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be the most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answer to the question of where novel ideas come from, it&rsquo;s curiosity. That&rsquo;s what people are usually feeling before having them.In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one another perfectly. Everyone I know who&rsquo;s independent-minded is deeply curious, and everyone I know who&rsquo;s conventional-minded isn&rsquo;t. Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps the reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious in the beginning, in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereas the independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keep eating even after they&rsquo;re full. [10]The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it.Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way muscles can. If you&rsquo;re sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don&rsquo;t need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity can compensate for them: if you&rsquo;re sufficiently curious, you don&rsquo;t need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable, you can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result. So there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Some independent-minded people are openly subversive, and others are quietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to avoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you&rsquo;re currently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is &ldquo;not much,&rdquo; maybe you should change something.The most important active step you can take to cultivate your curiosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Few adults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem as if you can choose which topics interest you. So it&rsquo;s up to you to find them. Or invent them, if necessary.Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by investigating things you&rsquo;re interested in. Curiosity is unlike most other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase rather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about truth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree people have the latter two, they&rsquo;re usually pretty general, whereas different people can be curious about very different things. So perhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to discover novel ideas, your motto should not be &ldquo;do what you love&rdquo; so much as &ldquo;do what you&rsquo;re curious about.&ldquo;Notes[1] One convenient consequence of the fact that no one identifies as conventional-minded is that you can say what you like about conventional-minded people without getting in too much trouble. When I wrote &ldquo;The Four Quadrants of Conformism&rdquo; I expected a firestorm of rage from the aggressively conventional-minded, but in fact it was quite muted. They sensed that there was something about the essay that they disliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific passage to pin it on.[2] When I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the answer is Twitter. It&rsquo;s not just full of conventional-minded people, as anything its size will inevitably be, but subject to violent storms of conventional-mindedness that remind me of descriptions of Jupiter. But while it probably is a net loss to spend time there, it has at least made me think more about the distinction between independent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have done otherwise.[3] The decrease in independent-mindedness in growing startups is still an open problem, but there may be solutions.Founders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only to hire independent-minded people. Which of course also has the ancillary benefit that they have better ideas.Another possible solution is to create policies that somehow disrupt the force of conformism, much as control rods slow chain reactions, so that the conventional-minded aren&rsquo;t as dangerous. The physical separation of Lockheed&rsquo;s Skunk Works may have had this as a side benefit. Recent examples suggest employee forums like Slack may not be an unmitigated good.The most radical solution would be to grow revenues without growing the company. You think hiring that junior PR person will be cheap, compared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average level of independent-mindedness in your company? (The growth in staff relative to faculty seems to have had a similar effect on universities.) Perhaps the rule about outsourcing work that&rsquo;s not your &ldquo;core competency&rdquo; should be augmented by one about outsourcing work done by people who&rsquo;d ruin your culture as employees.Some investment firms already seem to be able to grow revenues without growing the number of employees. Automation plus the ever increasing articulation of the &ldquo;tech stack&rdquo; suggest this may one day be possible for product companies.[4] There are intellectual fashions in every field, but their influence varies. One of the reasons politics, for example, tends to be boring is that it&rsquo;s so extremely subject to them. The threshold for having opinions about politics is much lower than the one for having opinions about set theory. So while there are some ideas in politics, in practice they tend to be swamped by waves of intellectual fashion.[5] The conventional-minded are often fooled by the strength of their opinions into believing that they&rsquo;re independent-minded. But strong convictions are not a sign of independent-mindedness. Rather the opposite.[6] Fastidiousness about truth doesn&rsquo;t imply that an independent-minded person won&rsquo;t be dishonest, but that he won&rsquo;t be deluded. It&rsquo;s sort of like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never unintentionally rude.[7] You see this especially among political extremists. They think themselves nonconformists, but actually they&rsquo;re niche conformists. Their opinions may be different from the average person&rsquo;s, but they are often more influenced by their peers&rsquo; opinions than the average person&rsquo;s are.[8] If we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that it excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity as well as falsehood in the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand further into the arts.[9] This correlation is far from perfect, though. Gödel and Dirac don&rsquo;t seem to have been very strong in the humor department. But someone who is both &ldquo;neurotypical&rdquo; and humorless is very likely to be conventional-minded.[10] Exception: gossip. Almost everyone is curious about gossip.
