<p>The Top of My Todo List April 2012A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the biggest regrets of the dying. Her list seems plausible. I could see myself — can see myself — making at least 4 of these 5 mistakes.If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might be: don&rsquo;t be a cog. The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops.The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission. You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy. Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of mistake, because you make them by default.I would like to avoid making these mistakes. But how do you avoid mistakes you make by default? Ideally you transform your life so it has other defaults. But it may not be possible to do that completely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them. So I inverted the 5 regrets, yielding a list of 5 commands Don&rsquo;t ignore your dreams; don&rsquo;t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy. which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.Japanese Translation</p>

<p>The Top Idea in Your Mind Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. July 2010I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the morning is more important than I&rsquo;d thought. I knew it was a good time to have ideas. Now I&rsquo;d go further: now I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s hard to do a really good job on anything you don&rsquo;t think about in the shower.Everyone who&rsquo;s worked on difficult problems is probably familiar with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing, and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something else. There&rsquo;s a kind of thinking you do without trying to. I&rsquo;m increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful in solving hard problems, but necessary. The tricky part is, you can only control it indirectly. [1]I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time. That&rsquo;s the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they&rsquo;re allowed to drift freely. And this idea will thus tend to get all the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of it. Which means it&rsquo;s a disaster to let the wrong idea become the top one in your mind.What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn&rsquo;t want as the top one in my mind for two long stretches.I&rsquo;d noticed startups got way less done when they started raising money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood why. The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with investors. The problem is that once you start raising money, raising money becomes the top idea in your mind. That becomes what you think about when you take a shower in the morning. And that means other questions aren&rsquo;t.I&rsquo;d hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I&rsquo;d forgotten why I hated it so much. When we raised money for Y Combinator, I remembered. Money matters are particularly likely to become the top idea in your mind. The reason is that they have to be. It&rsquo;s hard to get money. It&rsquo;s not the sort of thing that happens by default. It&rsquo;s not going to happen unless you let it become the thing you think about in the shower. And then you&rsquo;ll make little progress on anything else you&rsquo;d rather be working on. [2](I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors. Professors nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a little research on the side. It may be time to fix that.)The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the preceding 10 years I&rsquo;d been able to think about what I wanted. So the contrast when I couldn&rsquo;t was sharp. But I don&rsquo;t think this problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I&rsquo;ve seen grinds to a halt when they start raising money  or talking to acquirers.You can&rsquo;t directly control where your thoughts drift. If you&rsquo;re controlling them, they&rsquo;re not drifting. But you can control them indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get into. That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let become critical to you. Try to get yourself into situations where the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.You don&rsquo;t have complete control, of course. An emergency could push other thoughts out of your head. But barring emergencies you have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea in your mind.I&rsquo;ve found there are two types of thoughts especially worth avoiding  thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push out more interesting ideas. One I&rsquo;ve already mentioned: thoughts about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention sink. The other is disputes. These too are engaging in the wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely interesting ideas, but without the substance. So avoid disputes if you want to get real work done. [3]Even Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years, finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing: I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free of Mr Linus&rsquo;s business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally, excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come out after me. For I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or become a slave to defend it. [4] Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious critics. Newton&rsquo;s biographer Westfall seems to feel he was overreacting: Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton&rsquo;s &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; consisted of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over the course of a year. I&rsquo;m more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages, but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about other things.Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages. Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about it. If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the second half. I&rsquo;ve found I can to some extent avoid thinking about nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn&rsquo;t deserve space in my head. I&rsquo;m always delighted to find I&rsquo;ve forgotten the details of disputes, because that means I hadn&rsquo;t been thinking about them. My wife thinks I&rsquo;m more forgiving than she is, but my motives are purely selfish.I suspect a lot of people aren&rsquo;t sure what&rsquo;s the top idea in their mind at any given time. I&rsquo;m often mistaken about it. I tend to think it&rsquo;s the idea I&rsquo;d want to be the top one, rather than the one that is. But it&rsquo;s easy to figure this out: just take a shower. What topic do your thoughts keep returning to? If it&rsquo;s not what you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.Notes[1] No doubt there are already names for this type of thinking, but I call it &ldquo;ambient thought.&quot;[2] This was made particularly clear in our case, because neither of the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the process dragged on for months. Moving large amounts of money around is never something people treat casually. The attention required increases with the amount—maybe not linearly, but definitely monotonically.[3] Corollary: Avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will consist of dealing with money and disputes.[4] Letter to Oldenburg, quoted in Westfall, Richard, Life of Isaac Newton, p. 107.Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>

		<h1 id="trolls">Trolls</h1>
<p>Trolls February 2008A user on Hacker News recently posted a comment that set me thinking: Something about hacker culture that never really set well with me was this  the nastiness. &hellip; I just don&rsquo;t understand why people troll like they do. I&rsquo;ve thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of trolls. It&rsquo;s an old one, as old as forums, but we&rsquo;re still just learning what the causes are and how to address them.There are two senses of the word &ldquo;troll.&rdquo; In the original sense it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up fights in a forum by saying controversial things. [1] For example, someone who didn&rsquo;t use a certain programming language might go to a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait. This sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting a bat loose in a room full of people.The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in forums, whether intentionally or not. Now when people talk about trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word. Though in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways more accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it&rsquo;s usually uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate. That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes. The most important is distance. People will say things in anonymous forums that they&rsquo;d never dare say to someone&rsquo;s face, just as they&rsquo;ll do things in cars that they&rsquo;d never do as pedestrians  like tailgate people, or honk at them, or cut them off.Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers, and I think that&rsquo;s due to the kind of people you find there. Most of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract ideas than with people. Hackers can be abrupt even in person. Put them on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.The third cause of trolling is incompetence. If you disagree with something, it&rsquo;s easier to say &ldquo;you suck&rdquo; than to figure out and explain exactly what you disagree with. You&rsquo;re also safe that way from refutation. In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti. Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence: people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other way to do it than literally making a mark on the world. [2]The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum. Trolls are like children (many are children) in that they&rsquo;re capable of a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be tolerated. In a place where rudeness isn&rsquo;t tolerated, most can be polite. But vice versa as well.There&rsquo;s a sort of Gresham&rsquo;s Law of trolls: trolls are willing to use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful people aren&rsquo;t willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it. Which means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the dominant culture. That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched it happen to Reddit.News.YC is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate can be avoided. The sites&rsquo;s guidelines explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn&rsquo;t say face to face. If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and tell them to stop. And when people seem to be deliberately trolling, we ban them ruthlessly.Technical tweaks may also help. On Reddit, votes on your comments don&rsquo;t affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC. And it does seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark. Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments.One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial ideas, but empirically that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be what happens. When people say something substantial that gets modded down, they stubbornly leave it up. What people delete are wisecracks, because they have less invested in them.So far the experiment seems to be working. The level of conversation on News.YC is as high as on any forum I&rsquo;ve seen. But we still only have about 8,000 uniques a day. The conversations on Reddit were good when it was that small. The challenge is whether we can keep things this way.I&rsquo;m optimistic we will. We&rsquo;re not depending just on technical tricks. The core users of News.YC are mostly refugees from other sites that were overrun by trolls. They feel about trolls roughly the way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships. So there are a lot of people working to keep this from happening again. Notes[1] I mean forum in the general sense of a place to exchange views. The original Internet forums were not web sites but Usenet newsgroups.[2] I&rsquo;m talking here about everyday tagging. Some graffiti is quite impressive (anything becomes art if you do it well enough) but the median tag is just visual spam.Russian Translation</p>

<p>Why Twitter is a Big Deal April 2009Om Malik is the most recent of many people to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.The reason is that it&rsquo;s a new messaging protocol, where you don&rsquo;t specify the recipients. New protocols are rare. Or more precisely, new protocols that take off are. There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP (the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on. So any new protocol is a big deal. But Twitter is a protocol owned by a private company. That&rsquo;s even rarer.Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter have been slow to monetize it may in the long run prove to be an advantage. Because they haven&rsquo;t tried to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like previous protocols. One forgets it&rsquo;s owned by a private company. That must have made it easier for Twitter to spread.</p>

		<h1 id="unions">Unions</h1>
<p>An Alternative Theory of Unions May 2007People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age. In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing jobs that boosted the median income. I wouldn&rsquo;t quite call the high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it are reading too much into it.Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize where the high-paying union job came from. In a rapidly growing market, you don&rsquo;t worry too much about efficiency. It&rsquo;s more important to grow fast. If there&rsquo;s some mundane problem getting in your way, and there&rsquo;s a simple solution that&rsquo;s somewhat expensive, just take it and get on with more important things. EBay didn&rsquo;t win by paying less for servers than their competitors.Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a growth industry in the mid twentieth century. This was an era when small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and huge economies of scale. You had to grow fast or die. Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup. A reliable supply was more important than low cost.If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude must have been: sure, give &rsquo;em whatever they ask for, so long as the new model isn&rsquo;t delayed.In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was worth. Circumstances being what they were, companies would have been stupid to insist on paying them so little.If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the Internet Bubble. In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums of money for building the most trivial things. And yet does anyone who was there have any expectation those days will ever return? I doubt it. Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary aberration.The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration, just spread over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they would something like consulting during the Bubble.Basically, unions were just Razorfish.People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now? The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were giants. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral courage that&rsquo;s lacking today.In fact there&rsquo;s a simpler explanation. The early twentieth century was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure. And we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying union job. We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things.</p>

<p>Made in USA November 2004(This is a new essay for the Japanese edition of Hackers &amp; Painters. It tries to explain why Americans make some things well and others badly.)A few years ago an Italian friend of mine travelled by train from Boston to Providence. She had only been in America for a couple weeks and hadn&rsquo;t seen much of the country yet. She arrived looking astonished. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so ugly!&ldquo;People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine the squalor of the man-made bits of America. In travel books they show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon, whitewater rafting, horses in a field. If you see pictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a view of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance, or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine.How can it be, visitors must wonder. How can the richest country in the world look like this?Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence. Americans are good at some things and bad at others. We&rsquo;re good at making movies and software, and bad at making cars and cities. And I think we may be good at what we&rsquo;re good at for the same reason we&rsquo;re bad at what we&rsquo;re bad at. We&rsquo;re impatient. In America, if you want to do something, you don&rsquo;t worry that it might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, or that people might think you&rsquo;re getting above yourself. If you want to do something, as Nike says, just do it.This works well in some fields and badly in others. I suspect it works in movies and software because they&rsquo;re both messy processes. &ldquo;Systematic&rdquo; is the last word I&rsquo;d use to describe the way good programmers write software. Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after careful planning, like the pyramids. It&rsquo;s something they plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds, like a charcoal sketch.In software, paradoxical as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work slowly and meticulously, you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial, mistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization. Better to get a prototype done fast, and see what new ideas it gives you.It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software. Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections and usually quite different from what was originally envisioned. But interesting, and finished fairly quickly. I think we get away with this in movies and software because they&rsquo;re both malleable mediums. Boldness pays. And if at the last minute two parts don&rsquo;t quite fit, you can figure out some hack that will at least conceal the problem.Not so with cars, or cities. They are all too physical. If the car business worked like software or movies, you&rsquo;d surpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only fifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when you wanted to park it. But with physical products there are more constraints. You don&rsquo;t win by dramatic innovations so much as by good taste and attention to detail.The trouble is, the very word &ldquo;taste&rdquo; sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears. It seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate. Blue staters think it&rsquo;s &ldquo;subjective,&rdquo; and red staters think it&rsquo;s for sissies. So anyone in America who really cares about design will be sailing upwind.Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with the US car industry was the workers. We don&rsquo;t hear that any more now that Japanese companies are building cars in the US. The problem with American cars is bad design. You can see that just by looking at them.All that extra sheet metal on the AMC Matador wasn&rsquo;t added by the workers. The problem with this car, as with American cars today, is that it was designed by marketing people instead of designers.Why do the Japanese make better cars than us? Some say it&rsquo;s because their culture encourages cooperation. That may come into it. But in this case it seems more to the point that their culture prizes design and craftsmanship.For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we have in the West. When you look at swords they made in 1200, you just can&rsquo;t believe the date on the label is right. Presumably their cars fit together more precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has. They&rsquo;re obsessed with making things well.Not us. When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the job done. Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes. We can stop there, and have something crude but serviceable, like a Vise-grip. Or we can improve it, which usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament. When we want to make a car &ldquo;better,&rdquo; we stick tail fins on it, or make it longer, or make the windows smaller, depending on the current fashion.Ditto for houses. In America you can have either a flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion&ndash; a flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall, but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings. Rich people don&rsquo;t get better design or craftsmanship; they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the standard house.We don&rsquo;t especially prize design or craftsmanship here. What we like is speed, and we&rsquo;re willing to do something in an ugly way to get it done fast. In some fields, like software or movies, this is a net win. But it&rsquo;s not just that software and movies are malleable mediums. In those businesses, the designers (though they&rsquo;re not generally called that) have more power. Software companies, at least successful ones, tend to be run by programmers. And in the film industry, though producers may second-guess directors, the director controls most of what appears on the screen. And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all have this in common: the people in charge care about design&ndash; the former because the designers are in charge, and the latter because the whole culture cares about design.I think most Japanese executives would be horrified at the idea of making a bad car. Whereas American executives, in their hearts, still believe the most important thing about a car is the image it projects. Make a good car? What&rsquo;s &ldquo;good?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so subjective. If you want to know how to design a car, ask a focus group.Instead of relying on their own internal design compass (like Henry Ford did), American car companies try to make what marketing people think consumers want. But it isn&rsquo;t working. American cars continue to lose market share. And the reason is that the customer doesn&rsquo;t want what he thinks he wants.Letting focus groups design your cars for you only wins in the short term. In the long term, it pays to bet on good design. The focus group may say they want the meretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more is to imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a small minority, really do care about good design. Eventually the pimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyers have switched from Cadillac to Lexus, and do the same.Apple is an interesting counterexample to the general American trend. If you want to buy a nice CD player, you&rsquo;ll probably buy a Japanese one. But if you want to buy an MP3 player, you&rsquo;ll probably buy an iPod. What happened? Why doesn&rsquo;t Sony dominate MP3 players? Because Apple is in the consumer electronics business now, and unlike other American companies, they&rsquo;re obsessed with good design. Or more precisely, their CEO is.I just got an iPod, and it&rsquo;s not just nice. It&rsquo;s surprisingly nice. For it to surprise me, it must be satisfying expectations I didn&rsquo;t know I had. No focus group is going to discover those. Only a great designer can.Cars aren&rsquo;t the worst thing we make in America. Where the just-do-it model fails most dramatically is in our cities&ndash; or rather, exurbs. If real estate developers operated on a large enough scale, if they built whole towns, market forces would compel them to build towns that didn&rsquo;t suck. But they only build a couple office buildings or suburban streets at a time, and the result is so depressing that the inhabitants consider it a great treat to fly to Europe and spend a couple weeks living what is, for people there, just everyday life. [1]But the just-do-it model does have advantages. It seems the clear winner for generating wealth and technical innovations (which are practically the same thing). I think speed is the reason. It&rsquo;s hard to create wealth by making a commodity. The real value is in things that are new, and if you want to be the first to make something, it helps to work fast. For better or worse, the just-do-it model is fast, whether you&rsquo;re Dan Bricklin writing the prototype of VisiCalc in a weekend, or a real estate developer building a block of shoddy condos in a month.If I had to choose between the just-do-it model and the careful model, I&rsquo;d probably choose just-do-it. But do we have to choose? Could we have it both ways? Could Americans have nice places to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit that makes us good at software? Could other countries introduce more individualism into their technology companies and research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls? I&rsquo;m optimistic. It&rsquo;s harder to say about other countries, but in the US, at least, I think we can have both.Apple is an encouraging example. They&rsquo;ve managed to preserve enough of the impatient, hackerly spirit you need to write software. And yet when you pick up a new Apple laptop, well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem American. It&rsquo;s too perfect. It seems as if it must have been made by a Swedish or a Japanese company.In many technologies, version 2 has higher resolution. Why not in design generally? I think we&rsquo;ll gradually see national characters superseded by occupational characters: hackers in Japan will be allowed to behave with a willfulness that would now seem unJapanese, and products in America will be designed with an insistence on taste that would now seem unAmerican. Perhaps the most successful countries, in the future, will be those most willing to ignore what are now considered national characters, and do each kind of work in the way that works best. Race you.Notes[1] Japanese cities are ugly too, but for different reasons. Japan is prone to earthquakes, so buildings are traditionally seen as temporary; there is no grand tradition of city planning like the one Europeans inherited from Rome. The other cause is the notoriously corrupt relationship between the government and construction companies.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Barry Eisler, Sarah Harlin, Shiro Kawai, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and Eric Raymond for reading drafts of this.American GothicThe John Rain Books</p>

<p>How to Write Usefully February 2020What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That&rsquo;s what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it&rsquo;s not enough merely to be correct. It&rsquo;s easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That&rsquo;s a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can&rsquo;t go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it&rsquo;s a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.For example, it&rsquo;s more useful to say that Pike&rsquo;s Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say it&rsquo;s in the exact middle of Colorado, I&rsquo;ve now gone too far, because it&rsquo;s a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It&rsquo;s easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.It&rsquo;s also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn&rsquo;t already know.Telling people something they didn&rsquo;t know doesn&rsquo;t always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.Let&rsquo;s put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn&rsquo;t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can&rsquo;t expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world&rsquo;s 7 billion people. But it&rsquo;s sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true._____ How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he&rsquo;s sure it&rsquo;s worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they&rsquo;re usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don&rsquo;t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.You can&rsquo;t ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren&rsquo;t.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you&rsquo;re exploring gets inconclusive results, you&rsquo;re supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.I&rsquo;ve never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I&rsquo;m sure there are sentences I&rsquo;ve read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they&rsquo;re clumsily written, and sometimes because I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I&rsquo;m saying &ldquo;Ugh, that part&rdquo; each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won&rsquo;t publish an essay till they&rsquo;re all gone  till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I&rsquo;ll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can&rsquo;t think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn&rsquo;t seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence doesn&rsquo;t seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ve usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don&rsquo;t have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don&rsquo;t have to publish the essay at all, if you can&rsquo;t get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that&rsquo;s what it feels like. What&rsquo;s really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself. You&rsquo;re like a parent saying to a child &ldquo;we can sit here all night till you eat your vegetables.&rdquo; Except you&rsquo;re the child too.I&rsquo;m not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition (c) in &ldquo;A Way to Detect Bias&rdquo; after readers pointed out that I&rsquo;d omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There&rsquo;s a trick for getting importance too. It&rsquo;s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they&rsquo;ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. It&rsquo;s the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course that it&rsquo;s not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann sum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you&rsquo;ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who&rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. If you don&rsquo;t learn anything from writing an essay, don&rsquo;t publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know you&rsquo;re an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn&rsquo;t know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn&rsquo;t know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you&rsquo;re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm&rsquo;s length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you&rsquo;re pushing in the direction of less qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even want to, if it&rsquo;s a side point and a fully refined version would be too long.Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; because if you&rsquo;re saying it, then of course you think it. And it&rsquo;s true that &ldquo;I think x&rdquo; is a weaker statement than simply &ldquo;x.&rdquo; Which is exactly why you need &ldquo;I think.&rdquo; You need it to express your degree of certainty.But qualifications are not scalars. They&rsquo;re not just experimental error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it&rsquo;s so, even how it could be falsified. I&rsquo;m not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here. It&rsquo;s probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead I&rsquo;ll just give you a practical tip: Don&rsquo;t underestimate qualification. It&rsquo;s an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it&rsquo;s part of having them.There&rsquo;s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don&rsquo;t think this is a component of usefulness. It&rsquo;s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it&rsquo;s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I&rsquo;ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader&rsquo;s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that&rsquo;s too long.I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as you can._____ I believe the formula I&rsquo;ve given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should warn you that it&rsquo;s also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something they didn&rsquo;t know, they don&rsquo;t always thank you for it. Sometimes the reason people don&rsquo;t know something is because they don&rsquo;t want to know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And indeed, if you&rsquo;re looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.The strength component just makes things worse. If there&rsquo;s anything that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it&rsquo;s having them flatly contradicted.Plus if you&rsquo;ve used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who disagree with you. The reason you&rsquo;ll seem confident is that you are confident: you&rsquo;ve cheated, by only publishing the things you&rsquo;re sure of. It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that you never admit you&rsquo;re wrong. In fact you constantly admit you&rsquo;re wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you&rsquo;ll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly than you mean. To put &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; in front of something you&rsquo;re actually quite sure of. But you&rsquo;ll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink.I don&rsquo;t like to do this too much. It&rsquo;s cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That&rsquo;s sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice that&rsquo;s little consolation.In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you&rsquo;ve stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false.Much of the time they&rsquo;re not even doing it deliberately. One of the most surprising things you&rsquo;ll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you&rsquo;ve actually written. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that.For what it&rsquo;s worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. I say &ldquo;for what it&rsquo;s worth&rdquo; because they never do. So although it might seem that this could get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place.Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they&rsquo;re misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. In fact it&rsquo;s sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also model the way such an idea would be discovered.But I don&rsquo;t think you should explicitly forestall intentional misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to meet honest readers. You don&rsquo;t want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. But don&rsquo;t think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don&rsquo;t want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn&rsquo;t. I suspect it&rsquo;s the same skill._____ As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we&rsquo;ve examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is, the first component of importance: the number of people who care about what you write.If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you&rsquo;re an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only have ten readers who care, that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re helping them, and you&rsquo;re writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write about.The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication. Writing essays doesn&rsquo;t have to mean publishing them. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web came along I&rsquo;d had a lot of practice.Incidentally, Steve Wozniak did the same thing. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn&rsquo;t build them because he couldn&rsquo;t afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs in 1975, he was ready._____ How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I&rsquo;ve learned about essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.Although the essay is an old form, it hasn&rsquo;t been assiduously cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn&rsquo;t enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there&rsquo;s a path. Anyone can publish essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you can start. You don&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.The exciting thing is not that there&rsquo;s a lot left to write, but that there&rsquo;s a lot left to discover. There&rsquo;s a certain kind of idea that&rsquo;s best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.Notes[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don&rsquo;t put bars on the windows.[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for publication. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should do, and they were really helpful.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Spanish TranslationJapanese Translation</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve Learned from Users September 2022I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice I could give for getting in, per word, was Explain what you&rsquo;ve learned from users. That tests a lot of things: whether you&rsquo;re paying attention to users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need what you&rsquo;re making.Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned from YC&rsquo;s users, the startups we&rsquo;ve funded?The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it&rsquo;s surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of what they&rsquo;re making. Once you&rsquo;ve advised 100 startups all doing different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven&rsquo;t seen before.This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn&rsquo;t know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage investors might never realize this, because later stage investors might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner will get this much experience in the first year or two.That&rsquo;s one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies rather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot of data. Not just because you&rsquo;re looking at more companies, but also because more goes wrong.But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn&rsquo;t mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula. There&rsquo;s no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised by specific partners who know them well. [1]We learned that the hard way, in the notorious &ldquo;batch that broke YC&rdquo; in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn&rsquo;t realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn&rsquo;t know all the companies yet. [2]At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had happened. We were using an O(n2) algorithm. So of course it blew up.The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be.Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk about some problem, and we&rsquo;ll discover another much bigger one in the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties they&rsquo;re having raising money, and after digging into their situation, it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still haven&rsquo;t cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out to be that their product isn&rsquo;t good enough. There have been times when I&rsquo;ve asked &ldquo;Would you use this yourself, if you hadn&rsquo;t built it?&rdquo; and the founders, on thinking about it, said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Well, there&rsquo;s the reason you&rsquo;re having trouble getting users.Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative importance. [3] They&rsquo;ll come in to talk about three problems they&rsquo;re worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn&rsquo;t matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn&rsquo;t addressed immediately. It&rsquo;s like watching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that&rsquo;s mysteriously ajar. You want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die with some regularity, it&rsquo;s rarely because they wandered into a room containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are.Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often founders don&rsquo;t listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner who had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting to see the pattern. &ldquo;They come back a year later,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and say &lsquo;We wish we&rsquo;d listened to you.&rsquo;&ldquo;It took me a long time to figure out why founders don&rsquo;t listen. At first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That&rsquo;s part of the reason, but another and probably more important reason is that so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don&rsquo;t listen to us is that they don&rsquo;t believe us. At least not till experience teaches them otherwise. [4]The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they&rsquo;re so different from most people&rsquo;s other experiences. No one knows what it&rsquo;s like except those who&rsquo;ve done it. Which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it weren&rsquo;t counterintuitive, founders wouldn&rsquo;t need our advice about how to do it.Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don&rsquo;t have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don&rsquo;t matter, there&rsquo;s no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results.This doesn&rsquo;t imply that founders should rush forward regardless of the consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in practice there&rsquo;s less backtracking than you might expect. Founders usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if they have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their hypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because they&rsquo;ll talk about the results at office hours the next week. [5]A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot faster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and you can travel faster along it when you&rsquo;re more certain it&rsquo;s the right one. That&rsquo;s where a lot of YC&rsquo;s value lies, in helping founders get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes startups more startup-like.Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what &ldquo;it&rdquo; is. Partly because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly because many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have been trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by hacking the test instead of actually doing whatever it&rsquo;s supposed to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still see them reverting to their old habits.)YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge. It&rsquo;s more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It wouldn&rsquo;t be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn&rsquo;t be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That&rsquo;s why it can still be valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may be even more important than the advice of partners. If you look at history, great work clusters around certain places and institutions: Florence in the late 15th century, the University of Göttingen in the late 19th, The New Yorker under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC. However good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, very ambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else, because they&rsquo;re so starved for them in everyday life.Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those famous clusters, it won&rsquo;t be for lack of trying. We were very aware of this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to be one. By this point it&rsquo;s not bragging to say that it&rsquo;s the biggest cluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC concede that.Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces in the world, so you&rsquo;d expect it to have a big effect to combine them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question at all, most assumed they couldn&rsquo;t be combined — that loneliness was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when we were starting a startup.One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without having to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become a commodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never become a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some places means they&rsquo;re proportionally absent from the rest.Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energy in the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I&rsquo;ve experienced. We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to talk to. When you have a whole roomful it&rsquo;s another thing entirely.YC founders aren&rsquo;t just inspired by one another. They also help one another. That&rsquo;s the happiest thing I&rsquo;ve learned about startup founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it. The result is something far more intense than, say, a university. Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders are surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.Notes[1] This is why I&rsquo;ve never liked it when people refer to YC as a &ldquo;bootcamp.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s intense like a bootcamp, but the opposite in structure. Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they&rsquo;re each talking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup needs.[2] When I say the summer 2012 batch was broken, I mean it felt to the partners that something was wrong. Things weren&rsquo;t yet so broken that the startups had a worse experience. In fact that batch did unusually well.[3] This situation reminds me of the research showing that people are much better at answering questions than they are at judging how accurate their answers are. The two phenomena feel very similar.[4] The Airbnbs were particularly good at listening — partly because they were flexible and disciplined, but also because they&rsquo;d had such a rough time during the preceding year. They were ready to listen.[5] The optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes to get results, and that depends on the type of problem you&rsquo;re solving. When you&rsquo;re negotiating with investors, it could be a couple days, whereas if you&rsquo;re building hardware it could be months.

<p>Life is Short January 2016Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?Since there didn&rsquo;t seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it&rsquo;s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?It has for me. It means arguments of the form &ldquo;Life is too short for x&rdquo; have great force. It&rsquo;s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It&rsquo;s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.When I ask myself what I&rsquo;ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is &ldquo;bullshit.&rdquo; I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It&rsquo;s almost the definition of bullshit that it&rsquo;s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There&rsquo;s something fake about it. It&rsquo;s the junk food of experience. [1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that&rsquo;s bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people&rsquo;s mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it&rsquo;s either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you have to put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed, the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving. The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. But if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.If you&rsquo;re a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income.But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one&rsquo;s fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that&rsquo;s forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they&rsquo;re in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn&rsquo;t designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it&rsquo;s better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. [2]Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I&rsquo;ve written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive. Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask &ldquo;is this how I want to be spending my time?&ldquo;As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But most people start out with a life that&rsquo;s a mix of things that matter and things that don&rsquo;t, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you&rsquo;ll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That&rsquo;s how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren&rsquo;t necessarily the ones people would call &ldquo;important.&rdquo; Having coffee with a friend matters. You won&rsquo;t feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you&rsquo;re staring at your phone and say &ldquo;will you play with me?&rdquo; And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they&rsquo;re gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I&rsquo;d spent more time with her. I lived as if she&rsquo;d always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone&rsquo;s shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don&rsquo;t wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don&rsquo;t need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn&rsquo;t wait. Just don&rsquo;t wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn&rsquo;t have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense here.How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have. It&rsquo;s easy to let the days rush by. The &ldquo;flow&rdquo; that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms. One of the most striking things I&rsquo;ve read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter&rsquo;s Burning the Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat. I&rsquo;ve gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can&rsquo;t help noticing.It does help too to feel that you&rsquo;ve squeezed everything out of some experience. The reason I&rsquo;m sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn&rsquo;t. My oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don&rsquo;t have any regrets over what might have been. We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don&rsquo;t wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That&rsquo;s what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn&rsquo;t like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings. But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I get attacked a lot online. People tell the craziest lies about me. And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s not true!&ldquo;Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.Korean TranslationJapanese TranslationChinese Translation</p>

<p>The Venture Capital Squeeze November 2005In the next few years, venture capital funds will find themselves squeezed from four directions. They&rsquo;re already stuck with a seller&rsquo;s market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven&rsquo;t invested. This by itself is not the end of the world. In fact, it&rsquo;s just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it&rsquo;s getting so cheap to start a startup. The four causes: open source, which makes software free; Moore&rsquo;s law, which makes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you&rsquo;re good; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses. We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure http connections. We paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of memory. And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing. You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that programming languages have improved&ndash; or rather, the median language has. At most startups ten years ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in C++. Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python or Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to India. I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development to a more powerful language instead. A lot of well-known applications are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer. And one guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won&rsquo;t waste any time in meetings, and (b) since he&rsquo;s probably a founder, he can pay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now often want to give startups more money than the startups want to take. VCs like to invest several million at a time. But as one VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a million, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to do. Maybe we&rsquo;ll just have to give some of it back.&rdquo; Meaning give some of the fund back to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn&rsquo;t going to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley. Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers. An experienced CFO I know said flatly: &ldquo;I would not want to be CFO of a public company now.&ldquo;You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area where you can&rsquo;t go too far. But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have. This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. If Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public companies, that&rsquo;s proof enough that it&rsquo;s broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now. For all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought. Which means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3 man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100 million to acquire. They didn&rsquo;t mean to be in this business; it&rsquo;s just what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they can buy wholesale. Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive? Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don&rsquo;t want anyway. The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments. What they really want is the software and the developers, and that&rsquo;s what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated software and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out. &ldquo;Bring us your startups early,&rdquo; said Google&rsquo;s speaker at the Startup School. They&rsquo;re quite explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point where they would do a Series A round. (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate. Unless they want to have still more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it&rsquo;s just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you&rsquo;re still working for salary. Even if it&rsquo;s the right thing for your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves. They need to do two things, one of which won&rsquo;t surprise them, and another that will seem an anathema.Let&rsquo;s start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley loosened. This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to destroy the IPO market. Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have. But now that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact. These seedlings are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the economy. Much of the economy&rsquo;s growth is their growth. I think most politicians realize that. But they don&rsquo;t realize just how fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very little noise. If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you&rsquo;ll hear about it. But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry, all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash out partially in the Series A round. At the moment, when VCs invest in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the money goes to the company. They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this. They don&rsquo;t want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes public. VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they&rsquo;ll have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan. In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock early would generally be better for the company, because it would cause the founders&rsquo; attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the VCs&rsquo;. As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, while the VCs can afford to be &ldquo;rational&rdquo; and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up front. That first million is just worth so much more than the subsequent ones. If founders could sell a little stock early, they&rsquo;d be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger outcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least half million? The VCs would get same number of shares for the money. So what if some of the money would go to the founders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is unthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work growing the company. But the fact is, the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds, not the needs of startups. Often as not these large investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing it.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they&rsquo;re happy. And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a motivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you are now competing directly with Google.
