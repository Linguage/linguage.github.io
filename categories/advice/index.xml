&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A college degree is not a sign that one is a finished product but an indication a person is prepared for life.
— Edward Malloy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to college is a major event in one&amp;rsquo;s education, but the choice of exactly which college to go to is not as critical as it is sometimes portrayed to be; usually, there will be several good choices that suit your specific strengths and weaknesses, and it is not absolutely necessary to secure the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; choice for your undergraduate or graduate education. I would recommend a flexible attitude towards this decision; by focusing too much on one institution, you might overlook others which may in fact be a better fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
