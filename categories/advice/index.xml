      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/zh/which-universities-should-one-apply-to.zh/&#34;&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/which-universities-should-one-apply-to/&#34;&gt;原博客链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;which-universities-should-one-apply-to&#34;&gt;Which universities should one apply to?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A college degree is not a sign that one is a finished product but an indication a person is prepared for life.&#xA;— Edward Malloy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going to college is a major event in one&amp;rsquo;s education, but the choice of exactly which college to go to is not as critical as it is sometimes portrayed to be; usually, there will be several good choices that suit your specific strengths and weaknesses, and it is not absolutely necessary to secure the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; choice for your undergraduate or graduate education. I would recommend a flexible attitude towards this decision; by focusing too much on one institution, you might overlook others which may in fact be a better fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
