&lt;p&gt;过而不改，是谓过矣 [A man who has committed a mistake and doesn&amp;rsquo;t correct it, is committing another mistake.]&lt;br&gt;
(孔夫子 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius"&gt;Confucius&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;論語 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects"&gt;Analects&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody, least of all referees, enjoys a paper which is badly written and full of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the result itself is first-class, a cavalier attitude to expository or accuracy issues (or the presumption that it is solely up to the editor and referee, rather than the author, to address these issues) will negatively impact both the referee reports on the paper, and the editor&amp;rsquo;s final decision on the paper. (Even if the paper does eventually appear, these issues may also discourage potential readers from working their way through the paper.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Make your work available</title><link>https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/career-advice/orig/make-your-work-available/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2007 19:06:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/career-advice/orig/make-your-work-available/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/career-advice/zh/make-your-work-available.zh/"&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must get beyond textbooks, go out into the bypaths… and tell the world the glories of our journey.&lt;br&gt;
— John Hope Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the internet and world-wide web, and in particular with preprint servers such as the arXiv, there is really no excuse not to make your preprints (or other publication-quality writing) available online, so that anyone who is interested in your work can easily find it. (Most journals now also have online availability, but given that the gap between preprint release and publication is measured in years, it still makes sense to have the preprint online too.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
