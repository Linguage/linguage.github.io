There is a grain of truth to this; when a difficult mathematical problem is finally solved, it is often the case that the solution does make the original problem look significantly easier than had previously thought to be the case. Indeed, one could take the counter-intuitive point of view that progress in mathematics can be measured by how much of the subject has been made trivial (or at least easier to understand than previously).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question &amp;lsquo;How can we eat?&amp;rsquo;, the second by the question &amp;lsquo;Why do we eat?&amp;rsquo; and the third by the question, &amp;lsquo;Where shall we have lunch?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
