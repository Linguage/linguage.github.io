&lt;h1 id="on-time-management"&gt;On time management&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodded by several comments, I have finally decided to write up some my thoughts on time management here. I actually have been drafting something about this subject for a while, but I soon realised that my own experience with time management is still very much a work in progress (you should see my backlog of papers that need writing up) and I don’t yet have a coherent or definitive philosophy on this topic (other than my &lt;a href="https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/writing-guide/on-writing/"&gt;advice on writing papers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance my &lt;a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/write-a-rapid-prototype-first/"&gt;page on rapid prototyping&lt;/a&gt;). Also, I can only talk about my own personal experiences, which probably do not generalise to all personality types or work situations, though perhaps readers may wish to contribute their own thoughts, experiences, or suggestions in the comments here. [I should also add that I don’t always follow my own advice on these matters, often to my own regret.]&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Batch low-intensity tasks together</title><link>https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/career-advice/orig/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2007 21:08:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/career-advice/orig/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linguista.cn/person/terencetao/career-advice/zh/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together.zh/"&gt;中文版本&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to try one&amp;rsquo;s hand at many things than to concentrate one&amp;rsquo;s powers on one thing.
— Quintilian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tasks one is faced with in work can be broadly divided into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;High-intensity&amp;rdquo; tasks&lt;/strong&gt;, which are complex and require your full concentration and focus (e.g. writing a research paper; preparing for a class or talk; writing a lengthy, detailed, and careful email; thinking about a mathematical problem; reading a research paper or text), and&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
