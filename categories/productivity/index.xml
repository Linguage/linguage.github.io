At the time, I was mentioning how laborious it was for me to create a BibTeX file for dozens of references by using MathSciNet to locate each reference separately, and to export each one to BibTeX format. He then informed me that underneath to every MathSciNet reference there was a little link to add the reference to a Clipboard, and then one could export the entire Clipboard at once to whatever format one wished. In retrospect, this was a functionality of the site that had always been visible, but I had never bothered to explore it, and now I can populate a BibTeX file much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On time management</title>

I actually have been drafting something about this subject for a while, but I soon realised that my own experience with time management is still very much a work in progress (you should see my backlog of papers that need writing up) and I don’t yet have a coherent or definitive philosophy on this topic (other than my &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguage.github.io/terencetao/career-advice/orig/on-writing/&#34;&gt;advice on writing papers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance my &lt;a href=&#34;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/write-a-rapid-prototype-first/&#34;&gt;page on rapid prototyping&lt;/a&gt;). Also, I can only talk about my own personal experiences, which probably do not generalise to all personality types or work situations, though perhaps readers may wish to contribute their own thoughts, experiences, or suggestions in the comments here. [I should also add that I don’t always follow my own advice on these matters, often to my own regret.]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Actually writing down the argument that you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered formally can also be a daunting task, especially if the argument is lengthy and is not modeled on an existing one in the literature. While every individual detail of the argument may be clear to the author, the overall structure of the argument may not be immediately obvious. In particular, it is often difficult to make the (important) decisions about the:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Precept, study, advice, and example could never have taught them so well as failure has done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samuel Smiles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not every idea leads to a success, and not every first draft forms a good template for the final draft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is true even for the very best mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are times when a project just isn&amp;rsquo;t working the way it was initially planned, and you have to scale it down, refocus it, or shelve it altogether; or a lemma that you spent a lot of time on turns out not to add anything much to the paper and has to be reluctantly jettisoned or deferred to another paper; or that the structure of a half-written paper is clearly not optimal and that one needs to rewrite the entire thing from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While it is possible for routine or unexpectedly easy problems to fall within weeks, this is the exception rather than the rule. Thus it is not uncommon for months to pass with no visible progress; however by patiently eliminating fruitless avenues of attack, you are setting things up so that when the breakthrough does come, one can conclude the problem in relatively short order. (But &lt;strong&gt;be sceptical&lt;/strong&gt; of any breakthrough which was &amp;ldquo;too easy&amp;rdquo; and mysteriously failed to address the key difficulty.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Once you have experienced it, you are eager to repeat it but unable to do it at will, unless perhaps by dogged work…&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil&#34;&gt;André Weil&lt;/a&gt;, “The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relying on intelligence alone to pull things off at the last minute may work for a while, but, generally speaking, at the graduate level or higher it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
